# Executive Summary: Premium Tier Churn Prediction

**Date:** January 15, 2024

**Author:** Sarah Chen (Product Lead)

**Status:** In Planning

**TL;DR:** We're building a predictive system to identify at-risk premium customers 2-4 weeks before they cancel, enabling proactive outreach to reduce our $2M annual churn loss by an estimated 20-30%.

---

## What We're Doing

We're creating an automated system that analyzes customer behavior (login patterns, feature usage, support tickets) to predict which premium customers are likely to cancel in the next few weeks. This gives our Customer Success team time to intervene with personalized outreach, product education, or targeted offers before customers leave.

---

## Why It Matters

**Business Impact:**
- **$2M annual revenue at risk:** We're losing 8% of premium customers every month
- **Proactive vs. reactive:** Currently we only learn about churn after cancellation, when it's too late
- **Efficient resource allocation:** Focus CS team effort on the 10% highest-risk customers rather than generic retention campaigns

**Customer Value:**
- At-risk customers get personalized help before they become frustrated enough to leave
- Faster resolution of issues through proactive CS outreach
- Better product experience through targeted education

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Monthly premium churn rate | 8% | 6% (25% reduction) | Q3 2024 (6 months post-launch) |
| Annual revenue retained | $0 (reactive only) | $400K-600K | End of 2024 |
| Prediction accuracy | N/A | 80%+ precision | End Q1 2024 |
| CS team efficiency | Manual/reactive | Proactive outreach to top 10% at-risk | Q2 2024 |

---

## What Success Looks Like

**Short-term (End of Q1):** We have a working system that scores all premium customers daily and surfaces a prioritized list of at-risk users to the CS team in Salesforce with 80%+ accuracy.

**Medium-term (Q2):** CS team is using predictions to proactively reach out to 50-100 high-risk customers per week with personalized interventions. Initial results from our experiment show measurable reduction in churn.

**Long-term (End of 2024):** We've retained an additional $400K-600K in annual revenue by preventing 100-150 cancellations. The system runs automatically with quarterly updates, and we're expanding successful retention playbooks to other customer segments.

## Timeline & Investment

**Timeline:** 3-4 months (Late January - Late April/Early May)

**Investment:**
- **Data Science:** 12-16 person-weeks (~$60K-80K in loaded cost)
- **Engineering:** 3-4 person-weeks (~$15K-20K in loaded cost)
- **Total:** ~$75K-100K investment for $400K-600K potential annual return (4-8x ROI)

**Key Milestones:**
- **Week 1 (Jan 22):** Validation complete - confirm data quality, predictive signal exists, CS capacity, Salesforce feasibility
- **Week 6-8 (Early March):** System ready for testing with sample of customers
- **End of Q1 (Late March):** Full deployment to CS team
- **Q2 (April-June):** Run controlled experiment to measure impact
- **Mid-Q2 (May):** Production launch if experiment successful

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Data quality issues** (messy/inconsistent usage data could delay timeline) | Week 1 data audit to validate quality; prioritize cleanup if needed |
| **Weak predictive signal** (customer behavior may not reliably predict churn) | Week 1 exploratory analysis to validate signal exists before committing resources |
| **CS team capacity** (predictions are useless if CS can't handle outreach volume) | Confirming capacity with CS leadership immediately; adjust targeting % if needed |
| **Integration complexity** (Salesforce API limitations could block CS access) | Early prototype of integration in Week 1 to identify blockers |
| **Low intervention success** (outreach may not actually prevent churn) | Controlled experiment to measure real impact before full rollout |

**Overall Risk Level:** Medium

The Week 1 validation phase acts as a checkpoint - we'll only proceed if data quality, predictive signal, CS capacity, and technical feasibility all check out. This "fail fast" approach minimizes wasted investment.

## What We Need

**From Leadership:**
- **Approval to proceed:** ~$75K-100K investment for potential $400K-600K annual return
- **CS team prioritization:** Confirm CS can handle proactive outreach to 50-100 users/week
- **Discount budget approval:** Need authority for CS to offer retention discounts (amount TBD based on user value)

**From Other Teams:**
- **Engineering support:** 3-4 person-weeks for Salesforce integration and infrastructure
- **Data Engineering:** Access to usage data, support tickets, and billing data
- **Customer Success:** Partnership on intervention strategies and capacity commitment
- **Salesforce Admin:** API access and integration permissions

**Current Blockers:**
- None - ready to start Week 1 validation phase
- Need go/no-go decision after Week 1 based on validation results

---

## Status Update

**Project Phase:** Planning (Pre-Kickoff)

**Completed:**
- ✓ Stakeholder alignment meeting (Jan 15)
- ✓ Draft PRD created
- ✓ Rough effort estimates and timeline

**Next Steps (Week 1 - by Jan 22):**
- Data Science: Exploratory analysis to validate predictive signal exists
- Engineering: Assess Salesforce integration feasibility
- Product: Confirm CS team capacity with leadership
- All: Go/no-go decision meeting

**Decision Point:** After Week 1 validation, we'll decide whether to:
- **GO:** Proceed to full development if all validations pass
- **NO-GO:** Pause or pivot if data quality, signal, or feasibility concerns arise
- **MODIFY:** Adjust scope (e.g., lower targeting %, simpler integration) if partial concerns

**On Track?** N/A (not yet started)

## Why This Project, Why Now?

**Strategic Fit:**
- Aligns with Q2 retention initiative
- Leverages existing data (no new data collection needed)
- Builds on proven DS capability (similar to recent engagement prediction work)

**Timing:**
- Need testable solution by end of Q1 to support Q2 retention push
- Premium tier churn has been steady at 8% - time to address it proactively
- CS team has capacity and is eager for better targeting

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Status quo (reactive only):** Continue losing $2M/year
- **Manual CS outreach:** Too time-intensive, not scalable, no clear targeting
- **Generic retention campaigns:** Low precision, wastes discount budget on users who would stay anyway
- **Rule-based system:** Simpler but misses nuanced patterns that ML can capture

**Why this approach wins:** Balances accuracy, speed to market, and resource efficiency. Focuses on proven methods (gradient boosting) rather than experimental approaches.

## Appendix: Key Assumptions

1. **Churn drivers are behavioral:** We assume usage patterns, support ticket history, and engagement levels predict churn. Week 1 analysis will validate this.

2. **CS intervention is effective:** We assume proactive outreach reduces churn. Controlled experiment in Q2 will measure this.

3. **Predictability window:** We assume 2-4 weeks advance notice is achievable. Too early = users haven't decided yet; too late = already made decision.

4. **Precision over recall:** We optimize for accuracy (80%+ of flagged users actually churn) over catching every churner, because discount costs make false positives expensive.

5. **CS capacity exists:** We assume CS can handle ~50-100 proactive outreach/week. If not, we'll adjust targeting percentage.

6. **Data availability:** We assume historical usage, support, and churn data is available and reasonably clean. Week 1 audit will confirm.

These assumptions will be validated during the Week 1 checkpoint before committing to full development.
