# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Premium Tier Churn Prediction Model

**Owner:** Sarah Chen (Product Lead)

**DS Team:** Mike Rodriguez (DS Lead)

**Status:** Draft

**Last Updated:** 2024-01-15

## Executive Summary

This project aims to reduce premium tier churn by building a predictive model that identifies users at high risk of churning 2-4 weeks in advance, enabling proactive intervention by the Customer Success team. With current churn at 8% monthly (~$2M annual loss), the model will surface the top 10% highest-risk users weekly for targeted outreach including personalized engagement, product education, or discount offers.

## Background & Context

### Problem Statement

The company is experiencing 8% monthly churn in the premium tier, translating to approximately $2M in annual revenue loss. Currently, the company operates reactively, only learning about churn after users cancel. Exit interview survey response rate is only 20%, limiting insight into churn drivers. The lack of predictive capability prevents proactive intervention that could retain at-risk customers.

### Current State

- **Churn Rate:** 8% monthly in premium tier
- **Financial Impact:** ~$2M annual revenue loss
- **Detection Method:** Post-hoc (after cancellation)
- **Exit Interview Response Rate:** 20%
- **Common Cited Reasons:** "Not using features enough" (most common), "Cost concerns"
- **CS Observations:** Users who don't engage with core features in month 1 rarely stay; users with support tickets taking >3 days to resolve often churn in next billing cycle

### Opportunity

By predicting churn 2-4 weeks in advance, the Customer Success team can intervene with personalized outreach, targeted discounts, enhanced onboarding, or product education. This proactive approach could significantly reduce churn and recover a substantial portion of the $2M annual loss. The company tracks extensive usage data (login frequency, feature usage, support tickets, in-app behavior) that can power a predictive model.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals

1. Predict user churn 2-4 weeks in advance with ≥80% precision
2. Enable CS team to proactively intervene with highest-risk users
3. Reduce premium tier churn rate through targeted retention efforts
4. Launch testable solution by end of Q1 to support Q2 retention push

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeline |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Model Precision (users flagged who actually churn) | N/A | ≥80% | End of Q1 |
| Premium Tier Churn Rate | 8% monthly | [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] |
| Intervention Success Rate | N/A | [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | Post-A/B test (Q2) |
| ROI of Retention Program | N/A | [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | 6 months post-launch |

### Non-Goals

- Real-time churn prediction (daily batch is sufficient)
- Predicting churn for non-premium tiers (scope limited to premium)
- Automated intervention without human review (CS team will handle outreach)
- 100% recall (prioritizing precision over catching every churner)

- **Reliability:** Predictions must be available daily for CS team workflow
- **Privacy/Compliance:** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION - any data privacy or compliance requirements for using user behavioral data?]
- **Maintainability:** Model must be monitorable and retrainable with minimal manual intervention

## Proposed Solution

### Approach

Build a supervised binary classification model using gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) trained on historical user behavioral data and churn outcomes. The model will:

1. Process daily snapshots of user activity features
2. Generate churn probability scores for all premium users
3. Rank users by risk and surface top 10% to CS team via Salesforce
4. Enable A/B testing to validate impact of interventions on actual churn reduction

### Key Components

1. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**
   - Extract and engineer features from usage data (login frequency, feature engagement, support ticket patterns)
   - Create temporal features (trends, changes in behavior)
   - Aggregate features at appropriate time windows

2. **Churn Prediction Model**
   - Gradient boosting classifier (initial approach)
   - Trained on historical data with focus on maximizing precision
   - Regular quarterly retraining

3. **Scoring Pipeline**
   - Daily batch job scoring all premium users
   - Outputs ranked list with churn probabilities

4. **Salesforce Integration**
   - API integration to surface high-risk users in Salesforce
   - Dashboard or list view for CS team
   - Include risk scores and key signals/features

5. **Monitoring & Alerting System**
   - Track model performance metrics
   - Monitor prediction distributions for drift
   - Alert on anomalies or degradation
   - Feedback loop tracking actual outcomes

6. **A/B Testing Framework**
   - Treatment: CS outreach to high-risk users
   - Control: No proactive outreach
   - Measure impact on churn rate

### Alternative Approaches Considered

- **Real-time scoring:** Rejected because daily batch is sufficient for intervention timeline and reduces complexity
- **Simpler rule-based system:** Could use basic thresholds (e.g., no login in X days), but ML model can capture more nuanced patterns and interactions
- **More complex models (deep learning):** Starting with gradient boosting for speed; can iterate if needed

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies

- **Data:**
  - Access to historical usage data, support ticket data, and churn outcomes
  - Data must be clean and consistent (to be validated in exploratory analysis)
  - Data engineering support for building feature pipelines [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

- **Teams:**
  - Engineering team for Salesforce integration and infrastructure
  - CS team capacity to handle outreach (need to confirm can handle ~10% of premium users weekly)
  - Salesforce admin for API access and integration setup

- **Infrastructure:**
  - Batch processing infrastructure
  - Model serving/scoring infrastructure
  - Salesforce API access and permissions

- **External:**
  - Salesforce API limitations (to be investigated by Alex)

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Data quality issues (messy/inconsistent usage data) | High - could delay timeline significantly | Medium | Week 1 exploratory analysis to assess data quality; prioritize data cleaning |
| Weak predictive signal (churn is random) | High - model may not be useful | Medium | Week 1 exploratory analysis to validate signal exists (correlations between usage patterns and churn) |
| Salesforce integration complexity | Medium - could delay CS access | Medium | Early prototype of Salesforce integration; investigate API limitations upfront |
| CS team capacity constraints | High - predictions unused if CS can't handle volume | Medium | Confirm CS capacity with leadership; adjust top N% if needed |
| False positive rate too high (wasting money on discounts) | Medium - reduces ROI | Low-Medium | Optimize for precision (≥80%); start with small % and scale up |
| Model performance degrades over time | Medium - interventions become less effective | Medium | Quarterly retraining; monitoring/alerting for drift |
| Selection bias in historical data | Medium - model learns from incomplete data | Medium | Note in model documentation; iterate as more complete data collected |

## Experiment Design

### Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis:** Proactive CS outreach to users predicted as high-risk for churn will reduce actual churn rate compared to no intervention.

**Secondary Hypothesis:** Model can identify high-risk users with ≥80% precision 2-4 weeks before they churn.

### Experiment Setup

- **Treatment:** CS team reaches out to users flagged as top 10% highest churn risk with personalized interventions (product education, discounts, white-glove onboarding)
- **Control:** Business-as-usual (no proactive outreach to flagged users)
- **Randomization:** Randomly assign flagged high-risk users to treatment vs control [INFERRED - needs confirmation]
- **Sample Size:** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION - depends on number of flagged users and desired statistical power]
- **Duration:** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION - likely 4-6 weeks to observe churn outcomes]

### Success Criteria

- Churn rate in treatment group is statistically significantly lower than control
- Model precision validated at ≥80% on holdout test set

### Guardrail Metrics

- Overall satisfaction scores (ensure outreach doesn't annoy users)
- CS team utilization/bandwidth (ensure sustainable workload)
- Discount budget utilization (ensure costs are controlled)
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION - other business metrics to protect]
