# [Project Name] Data Science Project

# Project Canvas - Risk Assessment

## Value

1. Business Problem/Opportunity: summarize the core business challenge or potential opportunity
    a. Who is the user?
    b. What is the problem we want to solve for them?
2. Business or Product Metrics: how will success be measured at the product or user level?
3. Expected ROI: ie operational efficiency, new product sales, etc
4. Alignment with Product Strategy: how does this project support a defined business or product strategy?
5. Monday Board Link: what is the Monday board ticket item associated with this project?

## Viability
1. Data Availability: detail what data sources (databases, data warehouses, apis, etc) are available and add any links or documentation
2. Can the outbound dependancies for integration be cleared? who will be consuming this API and do they have the bandwidth to consume it? On what timeframe?
3. Solution Flow: a flow diagram outlining how you see the solution should work
4. Other Considerations (privacy, partnerships, etc):
5. Timeline Constraints: include deadlines or scheduling conflicts that might affect this project

## Feasibility
1. Input: what data will be sent to the data science service? be as specific as you can
2. Output: what data it will be returned from the data science service?
    a. If this is a chatbot project, provide a document with at least 20 examples (to start, will eventually need to be 100+) representing the breadth of questions we expect the system to be able to handle Each example should include at a minumum:
        i. Question: required to understand scope
        ii. Answer: shows us what a good answer looks like, even if the data are not correct
        iii. Data source: where will we get the data to answer this question?

3. Model Quality Metrics and Targets (Precision, Recall, ROC AUC, etc): if you are unsure our data science team can provide guidance
4. Other Performance Metrics (latency, throughput, etc):
5. Deliverable Format (ie API, batch process, etc):
6. Estimated Infrastructure and Compute Requirements:
7. Estimated Team Member Requirements: how many people from each team for how long?

## Usability
1. End User Persona: describe who will be using the final product that this API will support
2. User Experience Requirements (if appropriate): explain how will end users interact with the data sign service outputs
    a. Evidence for ML outputs
    b. Ability to fail gracefully

# Ways of Working

## Communication Channels

1. Working Team:
    a. Teams Channel (preferred):
    b. Email List:
    c. Meeting Cadence:

2. Leadership Stakeholder Updates (if not already represented by the Product, or otherwise needed):
    a. Update Method:
    b. Update Frequency:
