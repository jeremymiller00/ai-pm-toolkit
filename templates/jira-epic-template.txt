[Project Name] - Data Science Project
 

This PRD is a living document. It is perfectly acceptable to update sections as more information becomes available or as project requirements evolve. The purpose of this guide is to ensure a smooth collaboration among all teams, reduce misunderstandings, and support data-driven decision-making in our data science projects.

Project Canvas - Risk Assessment
Value
Business Problem/Opportunity: summarize the core business challenge or potential opportunity

Who is the user?

What is the problem we want to solve for them?

Business or Product Metrics: how will success be measured at the product or user level?

Expected ROI: ie operational efficiency, new product sales, etc

Alignment with Product Strategy: how does this project support a defined business or product strategy?

Monday Board Link: what is the Monday board ticket item associated with this project?

Viability
* Data Availability: detail what data sources (databases, data warehouses, apis, etc) are available and add any links or documentation

* Can the outbound dependancies for integration be cleared? who will be consuming this API and do they have the bandwidth to consume it?

On what timeframe?

Solution Flow: a flow diagram outlining how you see the solution should work

Other Considerations (privacy, partnerships, etc):

Timeline Constraints: include deadlines or scheduling conflicts that might affect this project

Feasibility
* Input: what data will be sent to the data science service? be as specific as you can

* Output: what data it will be returned from the data science service?

If this is a chatbot project, provide a document with at least 20 examples (to start, will eventually need to be 100+) representing the breadth of questions we expect the system to be able to handle Each example should include at a minumum:

Question: required to understand scope

Answer: shows us what a good answer looks like, even if the data are not correct

Data source: where will we get the data to answer this question?

* Model Quality Metrics and Targets (Precision, Recall, ROC AUC, etc): if you are unsure our data science team can provide guidance

* Other Performance Metrics (latency, throughput, etc):

* Deliverable Format (ie API, batch process, etc):

Estimated Infrastructure and Compute Requirements:

Estimated Team Member Requirements: how many people from each team for how long?

Usability
End User Persona: describe who will be using the final product that this API will support

User Experience Requirements (if appropriate): explain how will end users interact with the data sign service outputs

Evidence for ML outputs

Ability to fail gracefully

Additional Considerations for GenAI Chatbot Projects
Projects using generative AI (GenAI) chatbots require some extra upfront work and caution because these systems cannot be evaluated with standard Machine Learning techniques and can be prone to errors, sometimes in unexpected ways. Here’s what to consider:

Early Stage: Creating Examples and Setting Expectations
Example Questions and Answers:  
Provide a collection of questions that end users are likely to ask, along with ideal example responses.  These examples serve as a guide for the AI to understand context and desired outcomes. They also help in setting boundaries on language and scope.

Contextual Information:  
Describe the domain, such as clinical planning, novel drug development, or patient recruitment, so that the service is aligned with domain-specific language and policies.

Validation and Evaluation Process
SME Review:  
Before deployment, subject matter experts (SMEs) should manually review representative sample of the chatbot’s responses. Manual curation ensures accuracy, relevance, and safety.

Iterative Feedback Cycles:  
Expect to run through a few cycles of testing and review. In each cycle:

The GenAI chatbot’s output is compared with the provided examples.

SMEs evaluate the responses against predefined quality criteria.

Feedback is incorporated to fine-tune the responses.

Deployment Caution:  
Consider whether you want to release a valuable but flawed product to Early Access customers. Alternatively, you might plan to release only after clear, positive feedback from the evaluation cycles.  
Tip: Document all changes and key decisions during these cycles for transparency and continual improvement.
