b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/50-0
00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.469
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/51-0
00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:52.509
<v Malik, Hassan>There.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/52-0
00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.429
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So just starting and I at times may
switch between putting it in presentation</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/52-1
00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:02.669
<v Kumawat, Jaya>mode and bringing it back to the slide.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/53-0
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.909
<v Miller, Jeremy>It's fine, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/54-0
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So this is the product portfolio that I
spoke about, which is market access,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/54-1
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Kumawat, Jaya>real world data,
new products development and I will now</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/54-2
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.994
<v Kumawat, Jaya>go into the strategy and roadmaps.
This is the suite of the products which</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/54-3
00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:18.982
<v Kumawat, Jaya>we've listed.
We are currently first starting with</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/54-4
00:05:18.982 --> 00:05:23.669
<v Kumawat, Jaya>intelligent NPI targeting and we have a
very solid reason why we're calling it.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/55-0
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.305
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Intelligent NPI targeting,
which I'll come to gradually.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/55-1
00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:30.735
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So these are the road maps.
As a part of the road map,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/55-2
00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:35.414
<v Kumawat, Jaya>all I'd like to show is the early release
for Intelligent NPI targeting is</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/55-3
00:05:35.414 --> 00:05:39.968
<v Kumawat, Jaya>scheduled for 18th of December.
So we are looking at this specific date.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/55-4
00:05:39.968 --> 00:05:43.149
<v Kumawat, Jaya>You see the date EA for INT and PBM 18th
December.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/58-0
00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:47.484
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Not the full product, Jeremy and Hassan,
this is we have scoped it out to a</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/58-1
00:05:47.484 --> 00:05:51.811
<v Kumawat, Jaya>limited scope because we want to get
something out and rolling and so that we</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/56-0
00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:49.229
<v Miller, Jeremy>No.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/58-2
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:56.248
<v Kumawat, Jaya>can start working with customers to get
traction on whether we are on the right</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/57-0
00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:55.309
<v Miller, Jeremy>That.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/58-3
00:05:56.248 --> 00:05:59.742
<v Kumawat, Jaya>track with the product or we are not,
what what's going right,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/58-4
00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:02.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>what's not going so right,
so on and so forth.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/60-0
00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:08.626
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So coming to the problem statement and
the solution,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/60-1
00:06:08.626 --> 00:06:14.047
<v Kumawat, Jaya>so we're calling it intelligent NPI
targeting because so just like you Hassan,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/60-2
00:06:14.047 --> 00:06:19.537
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Sunil and I, we also come from Clarivate.
We build the DRG Fusion platform over</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/59-0
00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:17.549
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/60-3
00:06:19.537 --> 00:06:19.949
<v Kumawat, Jaya>there.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/61-0
00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:27.088
<v Kumawat, Jaya>The entire platform was was being led by
me. Sunil was in my team over there.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/61-1
00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:32.456
<v Kumawat, Jaya>On that platform we had two major gaps.
One was the EHR data did not have</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/61-2
00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:37.752
<v Kumawat, Jaya>physician clinical notes #1 #2,
the real world data for the platform did</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/61-3
00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:40.509
<v Kumawat, Jaya>not integrate with market access data.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/63-0
00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:47.165
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Both of these major gaps get bridged with
this particular solution and this data</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/63-1
00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:52.517
<v Kumawat, Jaya>strategy that we are proposing.
So what we want to do is we want to</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/63-2
00:06:52.517 --> 00:06:58.736
<v Kumawat, Jaya>target the right NPIs at the right time,
but what we're trying to do is we are</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/62-0
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.989
<v Miller, Jeremy>Sure.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/63-3
00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:00.389
<v Kumawat, Jaya>trying to solve very.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/64-0
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Specialized specific business problems
for the industry through HCP targeting,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/64-1
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.519
<v Kumawat, Jaya>which can only be solved through
physician clinical notes and mapping that</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/64-2
00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:17.057
<v Kumawat, Jaya>to market access data.
So This is why we are calling this</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/64-3
00:07:17.057 --> 00:07:20.109
<v Kumawat, Jaya>intelligent NPI targeting without this.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/67-0
00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.221
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Integration,
we wouldn't be doing INT this,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/67-1
00:07:23.221 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Kumawat, Jaya>that's intelligent and peer targeting.
All the use cases that we are presenting</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/65-0
00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:23.949
<v Miller, Jeremy>She.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/67-2
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.390
<v Kumawat, Jaya>from here on are very specialized.
They're not the traditional NCP targeting.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/67-3
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.603
<v Kumawat, Jaya>We do have a basic NCP targeting module,
which is the conventional NCP targeting</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/66-0
00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:38.909
<v Miller, Jeremy>Oh, great.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/67-4
00:07:38.603 --> 00:07:38.989
<v Kumawat, Jaya>model.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/68-0
00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:43.999
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Going to the next and I'll not go to the
verbose of all of this,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/68-1
00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:49.936
<v Kumawat, Jaya>the entire strategy for INTI have put it
in this pictorial representation which is</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/68-2
00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:54.657
<v Kumawat, Jaya>all of these data assets with market
access data, medical claims,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/68-3
00:07:54.657 --> 00:07:58.949
<v Kumawat, Jaya>prescription claims and EHR we are
integrating. We plan to.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/69-0
00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:04.599
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Be great and have these data talk to each
other and then come up with these six</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/69-1
00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:08.080
<v Kumawat, Jaya>modules.
The one that you see right on the top is</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/69-2
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.979
<v Kumawat, Jaya>the traditional NCP targeting that I was
talking about.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/69-3
00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:15.669
<v Kumawat, Jaya>All the rest are the specialized modules
that solve.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/70-0
00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:17.069
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Critical.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/72-0
00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:22.187
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Industry problems that can be solved only
through NPIs.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/72-1
00:08:22.187 --> 00:08:28.645
<v Kumawat, Jaya>That's what we are trying to do and I'll
not take each of them because Sunil has a</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/71-0
00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:26.909
<v Miller, Jeremy>She OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/72-2
00:08:28.645 --> 00:08:34.793
<v Kumawat, Jaya>working prototype and I think when he
runs us through the prototype it'll make</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/72-3
00:08:34.793 --> 00:08:36.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>a lot more sense so.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/73-0
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:41.105
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I know spoke too much.
Any questions so far, Hassan, Jeremy,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/73-1
00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:41.789
<v Kumawat, Jaya>anything?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/77-0
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:45.956
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, I mean,
we'd love to understand use cases in a</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/77-1
00:08:45.956 --> 00:08:50.972
<v Malik, Hassan>bit more detail, potential business value,
um, et cetera, right. High level, I mean,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/74-0
00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:46.469
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/77-2
00:08:50.972 --> 00:08:54.749
<v Malik, Hassan>it makes sense, uh, to to as areas to,
you know, consider, Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/76-0
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:52.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK, OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/75-0
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:52.829
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/78-0
00:08:53.749 --> 00:08:57.864
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah, OK,
so these if the yellow bar on the top,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/78-1
00:08:57.864 --> 00:09:03.995
<v Kumawat, Jaya>this is the title of the use case.
For each of the use cases we have the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/78-2
00:09:03.995 --> 00:09:10.462
<v Kumawat, Jaya>personas to whom this would be targeted,
the business problem, the solution.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/78-3
00:09:10.462 --> 00:09:13.149
<v Kumawat, Jaya>These are the KPIs and the KBQS.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/79-0
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:18.806
<v Kumawat, Jaya>The value proposition in terms of what is
the value to the customers,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/79-1
00:09:18.806 --> 00:09:24.935
<v Kumawat, Jaya>the potential financial impact these use
cases have had or will be having on the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/79-2
00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:31.139
<v Kumawat, Jaya>industry and the customers over here that
we're talking about is specifically the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/79-3
00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:31.669
<v Kumawat, Jaya>pharma.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/80-0
00:09:31.749 --> 00:09:37.563
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Biopharma and pharmaceutical customers
only 90% and there could be peers who</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/80-1
00:09:37.563 --> 00:09:42.698
<v Kumawat, Jaya>could also be biased to this,
but essentially it's more going to be</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/80-2
00:09:42.698 --> 00:09:47.229
<v Kumawat, Jaya>with the sales team, the brand teams,
the commercial teams.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/81-0
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:52.869
<v Kumawat, Jaya>And the medical affairs team at times
when they are working with the brand</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/81-1
00:09:52.869 --> 00:09:57.103
<v Kumawat, Jaya>teams on the brand strategy.
So these are the personas and the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/81-2
00:09:57.103 --> 00:10:02.211

00:10:09.349 --> 00:10:09.789
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/85-1
00:10:10.368 --> 00:10:14.223
<v Kumawat, Jaya>impact prescribers for a disease or for a
treatment,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/83-0
00:10:11.909 --> 00:10:13.349
<v Miller, Jeremy>everybody.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/85-2
00:10:14.223 --> 00:10:17.424
<v Kumawat, Jaya>we want to know who are the top
physicians,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/85-3
00:10:17.424 --> 00:10:22.152
<v Kumawat, Jaya>where are these physicians consulting
with as in the facilities,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/85-4
00:10:22.152 --> 00:10:25.789
<v Kumawat, Jaya>who are the top specialties in these
prescribers?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/87-0
00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:29.402
<v Kumawat, Jaya>And the geographical distribution of
these physicians?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/84-0
00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:28.349
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/87-1
00:10:29.402 --> 00:10:34.419
<v Kumawat, Jaya>What has been the performance or trends
of these physicians in terms of growth</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/87-2
00:10:34.419 --> 00:10:38.865
<v Kumawat, Jaya>for a product quarter on quarter?
How many prescriptions do they have</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/87-3
00:10:38.865 --> 00:10:40.389
<v Kumawat, Jaya>across with geographies?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/86-0
00:10:40.229 --> 00:10:40.509
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/89-0
00:10:41.109 --> 00:10:44.888
<v Kumawat, Jaya>That's what we're trying to cover.
And of these physicians,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/89-1
00:10:44.888 --> 00:10:49.548
<v Kumawat, Jaya>how many have a favorable access?
How many do not have a favorable access</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/89-2
00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:52.949
<v Kumawat, Jaya>for the specific product in the disease?
That is the.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/91-0
00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:57.709
<v Kumawat, Jaya>High impact prescribers.
Any doubts on Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/90-0
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.669
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/93-0
00:10:55.709 --> 00:10:59.854
<v Malik, Hassan>So there is a yeah, yes,
I have some questions here. So, so,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/93-1
00:10:59.854 --> 00:11:05.019
<v Malik, Hassan>so the first one is it seems like someone
is who's already writing a lot of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/92-0
00:11:01.549 --> 00:11:03.109
<v Miller, Jeremy>Oh, **** it.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/93-2
00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:08.757
<v Malik, Hassan>prescriptions,
increasing the number there and and and</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/93-3
00:11:08.757 --> 00:11:14.057
<v Malik, Hassan>hitting these 15 to 20% increase goals
may be tougher than trying to identify</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/93-4
00:11:14.057 --> 00:11:14.669
<v Malik, Hassan>the ones.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/95-0
00:11:14.789 --> 00:11:19.928
<v Malik, Hassan>That have similar characteristics but are
not writing these many prescriptions,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/95-1
00:11:19.928 --> 00:11:23.460
<v Malik, Hassan>right? So maybe so,
so maybe they need more education,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/95-2
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.792
<v Malik, Hassan>incentives, you know, whatever they need.
But that may be a more realistic or or a</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/95-3
00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:30.269
<v Malik, Hassan>more reasonable target.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/94-0
00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:31.629
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah, I like it.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/97-0
00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:33.546
<v Malik, Hassan>Right.
So I so that would still require building,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/97-1
00:11:33.546 --> 00:11:38.207
<v Malik, Hassan>you know, who you know everything in here,
but the recommendations would be very</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/97-2
00:11:38.207 --> 00:11:41.486
<v Malik, Hassan>different, right,
than someone who is already doing what</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/97-3
00:11:41.486 --> 00:11:44.939
<v Malik, Hassan>you want them to do.
There may be some opportunities there,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/97-4
00:11:44.939 --> 00:11:48.909
<v Malik, Hassan>but it'll pretty much pretty, you know,
quickly hit a ceiling there.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/98-0
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:55.156
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So our typical use of this,
which every farmer uses, Hassan,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/98-1
00:11:55.156 --> 00:12:01.093
<v Kumawat, Jaya>there is no single farmer who will not
want this particular use case for any of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/98-2
00:12:01.093 --> 00:12:05.694
<v Kumawat, Jaya>their competitive intelligence,
any product that is launched,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/98-3
00:12:05.694 --> 00:12:07.549
<v Kumawat, Jaya>they are about to launch.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/100-0
00:12:08.229 --> 00:12:13.486
<v Kumawat, Jaya>They need to find out who are the
physicians who prescribe either this</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/100-1
00:12:13.486 --> 00:12:18.372
<v Kumawat, Jaya>product or this or a similar competitor
product and they want to.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/100-2
00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:23.851
<v Kumawat, Jaya>They want the medical representatives to
go to those specific physicians.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/100-3
00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:27.109
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So that is the typical physician
targeting.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/99-0
00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:29.389
<v Miller, Jeremy>It's prelaunch. I think that's the key.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/103-0
00:12:27.349 --> 00:12:32.273
<v Kumawat, Jaya>CP targeting now those physicians,
what are their specialties and what are</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/102-0
00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:32.549
<v Malik, Hassan>OK, so so OK, so so so then that.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/103-1
00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:36.869
<v Kumawat, Jaya>they as in which hospitals do they
consult with? Are they associated?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/101-0
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.229
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/107-0
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:41.230
<v Malik, Hassan>OK, got it. So, so,
so these are so it's a for a new product,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/107-1
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.818
<v Malik, Hassan>it's for an existing therapy area where
there are you know prescribers writing</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/107-2
00:12:45.818 --> 00:12:50.406
<v Malik, Hassan>current drugs but current products but
and they have the potential to get this</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/104-0
00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:49.749
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/105-0
00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:50.269
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/107-3
00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:53.891
<v Malik, Hassan>new you know be high volume prescribes
for the new one. OK,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/107-4
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:55.749
<v Malik, Hassan>so that that's a valid use case.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/108-0
00:12:55.749 --> 00:13:00.431
<v Malik, Hassan>I sort of saw it more like, you know,
for existing products. Um, so, so,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/106-0
00:12:57.229 --> 00:12:57.829
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/108-1
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:05.563
<v Malik, Hassan>so there the, you know, targeting, uh,
you know, would would be very different.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/108-2
00:13:05.563 --> 00:13:06.589
<v Malik, Hassan>OK, makes sense.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/109-0
00:13:09.349 --> 00:13:15.247
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Makes sense and this necessarily doesn't
have to be a new for a new product launch,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/109-1
00:13:15.247 --> 00:13:19.530
<v Kumawat, Jaya>even for an existing product.
A pharma company, for example,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/109-2
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:24.515
<v Kumawat, Jaya>was expecting that this product will
reach out to 10 million patients,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/109-3
00:13:24.515 --> 00:13:25.709
<v Kumawat, Jaya>for example only.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/110-0
00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:31.163
<v Kumawat, Jaya>But when they look at their sales data,
they find that instead of 10 million</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/110-1
00:13:31.163 --> 00:13:34.159
<v Kumawat, Jaya>patients,
this product has only reached to 1,000,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/110-2
00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:37.335
<v Kumawat, Jaya>000 patients,
which means they have not yet found or</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/110-3
00:13:37.335 --> 00:13:42.069
<v Kumawat, Jaya>they have not yet targeted the right
physicians prescribers for their product.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/111-0
00:13:43.109 --> 00:13:48.842
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So this could be a use case even for an
existing product already in the market.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/111-1
00:13:48.842 --> 00:13:54.432
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So this is where this this use case is
invariably used by every single small,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/111-2
00:13:54.432 --> 00:13:58.589
<v Kumawat, Jaya>mid size, big size farmers.
Everybody uses this use case.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/112-0
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:01.509
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Makes sense, Hassan.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/113-0
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.629
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/114-0
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.789
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah, OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/115-0
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:12.002
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I'll go to the next one.
The next one is a very specialized use</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/115-1
00:14:12.002 --> 00:14:18.584
<v Kumawat, Jaya>case which is market. As in for a drug,
there has been a new pair win,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/115-2
00:14:18.584 --> 00:14:21.829
<v Kumawat, Jaya>but the pair win has not been able.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/116-0
00:14:21.989 --> 00:14:27.061
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Has not been capitalized by the pharmacy.
So they have a pair win for which now</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/116-1
00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:30.738
<v Kumawat, Jaya>because they have a preferred tier,
the drug has gone in.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/116-2
00:14:30.738 --> 00:14:35.303
<v Kumawat, Jaya>They would have expected the number of
prescription volumes to go high,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/116-3
00:14:35.303 --> 00:14:40.629
<v Kumawat, Jaya>number of patients on the drug to go high,
but from the claims data they find that.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/117-0
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:45.380
<v Kumawat, Jaya>It it it didn't read the target,
it should have.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/117-1
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.160
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So they will now in order to go and find
that gap,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/117-2
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.236
<v Kumawat, Jaya>they will need to find the physicians who
ideally should have prescribed for this</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/117-3
00:14:55.236 --> 00:14:58.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>drug which has had an additional pair win.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/118-0
00:14:59.349 --> 00:15:02.640
<v Kumawat, Jaya>But it didn't.
So that's another use case of market</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/118-1
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.008
<v Kumawat, Jaya>access pull through for this,
while the number of prescriptions will</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/118-2
00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:12.135
<v Kumawat, Jaya>come through the RX and the MX claims,
but the validity of the formulary and the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/118-3
00:15:12.135 --> 00:15:15.869
<v Kumawat, Jaya>policy restrictions will come from the
market access data.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/119-0
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:23.446
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So every use case has a mapping between
real world data and between market access</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/119-1
00:15:23.446 --> 00:15:23.869
<v Kumawat, Jaya>data.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/125-0
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:31.330
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, this seems pretty straightforward.
I think you know from a contract</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/121-0
00:15:29.869 --> 00:15:31.149
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Oh, good.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/120-0
00:15:30.349 --> 00:15:30.749
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/125-1
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:36.662
<v Malik, Hassan>perspective because you know you have
sort of events and you know expected</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/125-2
00:15:36.662 --> 00:15:42.563
<v Malik, Hassan>outcome of an event and can basically see
where the expected outcome is not met or</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/122-0
00:15:38.869 --> 00:15:39.429
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/125-3
00:15:42.563 --> 00:15:45.549
<v Malik, Hassan>below certain thresholds or below average.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/123-0
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.749
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/128-0
00:15:44.789 --> 00:15:48.234
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, yeah,
I think the the nuance will be defining</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/126-0
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:46.509
<v Malik, Hassan>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/124-0
00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:47.949
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/128-1
00:15:48.234 --> 00:15:53.336
<v Miller, Jeremy>and according to our business what is a
pay or win in each case because it's</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/127-0
00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:53.229
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/128-2
00:15:53.336 --> 00:15:57.709
<v Miller, Jeremy>probably not going to be consistent.
So but that's the detail we.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/130-0
00:15:56.309 --> 00:16:01.114
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, and all, yeah.
And also I think it will have a it will,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/129-0
00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:01.229
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yes, Jen, that's right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/130-1
00:16:01.114 --> 00:16:03.749
<v Malik, Hassan>yeah, it will have this aspect of.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/131-0
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:06.589
<v Kumawat, Jaya>And additionally, Jeremy,
because you're gonna be work, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/133-0
00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:10.527
<v Malik, Hassan>No, no, go,
go ahead finish and then I'll I'll share</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/132-0
00:16:07.909 --> 00:16:14.749
<v Kumawat, Jaya>No, please go ahead. Yeah, yeah,
whatever is staying on.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/133-1
00:16:10.527 --> 00:16:13.786
<v Malik, Hassan>something. OK. So OK.
So when we are when we are ranking,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/133-2
00:16:13.786 --> 00:16:18.000
<v Malik, Hassan>yeah when we are ranking you know the so
there is this event you know this</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/133-3
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.270
<v Malik, Hassan>happened there should be and there is
this expected impact that the we will</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/133-4
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.349
<v Malik, Hassan>still need to sort of you know these.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/136-0
00:16:24.549 --> 00:16:27.477
<v Malik, Hassan>HCPS we will still need to cluster them
somehow.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/136-1
00:16:27.477 --> 00:16:32.079
<v Malik, Hassan>So because you can't just say you know
these are the the highest volume ones</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/134-0
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.669
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/136-2
00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Malik, Hassan>versus these are not because there are
going to be all kind of other things you</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/136-3
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.549
<v Malik, Hassan>know such as patient population for
example.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/138-0
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:42.460
<v Malik, Hassan>You know that this C with a specific,
you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/135-0
00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:40.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/138-1
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.981
<v Malik, Hassan>medical condition or therapy area,
et cetera,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/138-2
00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:49.256
<v Malik, Hassan>that you know those things will have to
come into play and then we'll have to</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/138-3
00:16:49.256 --> 00:16:53.202
<v Malik, Hassan>compare them against the their peer group
and then highlight, you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/137-0
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:52.149
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/138-4
00:16:53.202 --> 00:16:54.189
<v Malik, Hassan>anomalies per say.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/140-0
00:16:54.789 --> 00:16:58.091
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah. So,
so to put it very to summarize this,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/139-0
00:16:55.109 --> 00:16:56.349
<v Malik, Hassan>Sorry, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/140-1
00:16:58.091 --> 00:17:02.517
<v Kumawat, Jaya>this particular use case will help to
capitalize on pair wins.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/140-2
00:17:02.517 --> 00:17:07.506
<v Kumawat, Jaya>And for this we may need to go right now.
I know we don't have it in a</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/140-3
00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:11.651
<v Kumawat, Jaya>comprehensive way,
but for this we may have to look at the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/140-4
00:17:11.651 --> 00:17:13.829
<v Kumawat, Jaya>prescription behaviors as well.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/142-0
00:17:14.629 --> 00:17:19.092
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Well, we have a pair win.
We expected the physicians to prescribe</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/142-1
00:17:19.092 --> 00:17:23.487
<v Kumawat, Jaya>for a drug. They are not,
which means that the awareness for the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/142-2
00:17:23.487 --> 00:17:28.152
<v Kumawat, Jaya>pair win is not yet there.
So what are these physicians prescribing?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/141-0
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.869
<v Miller, Jeremy>So.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/142-3
00:17:28.152 --> 00:17:33.629
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So in order to understand this physician
prescription behavior, we will have to.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/144-0
00:17:34.469 --> 00:17:36.629
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Read into the EHR clinical notes as well.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/145-0
00:17:38.069 --> 00:17:42.127
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So, so, so a lot happening here,
a lot happening here, but but yeah,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/143-0
00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:39.069
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/145-1
00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:45.949
<v Kumawat, Jaya>it's definitely a a use case with a very
good value proposition.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/148-0
00:17:46.989 --> 00:17:51.789
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, I think that configurable.
So how different the so as Jeremy said</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/146-0
00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:49.149
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/148-1
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:55.589
<v Malik, Hassan>earlier, right,
this will come down to defining pair win</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/148-2
00:17:55.589 --> 00:18:01.122
<v Malik, Hassan>and I think we'll need to understand how
you know similar these different types of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/148-3
00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:01.989
<v Malik, Hassan>win wins are.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/147-0
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.909
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/150-0
00:18:03.429 --> 00:18:07.623
<v Malik, Hassan>Because if each one and is expected,
in fact you know impact is very different</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/150-1
00:18:07.623 --> 00:18:10.756
<v Malik, Hassan>from from each other,
then it will become quite complex to</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/150-2
00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:14.578
<v Malik, Hassan>build. If it's somewhat similar,
then we may be able to just build some</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/150-3
00:18:14.578 --> 00:18:18.029
<v Malik, Hassan>templates here and say for your heritage
this new type of a win.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/149-0
00:18:15.869 --> 00:18:16.189
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/152-0
00:18:18.469 --> 00:18:23.151
<v Malik, Hassan>Like and here is the expected impact and
you know this bunch of different</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/152-1
00:18:23.151 --> 00:18:26.884
<v Malik, Hassan>configurations and it it pretty much just
works, you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/152-2
00:18:26.884 --> 00:18:29.858
<v Malik, Hassan>so so it can start with classifying,
you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/152-3
00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:34.919
<v Malik, Hassan>detecting you know the one of the known
wins and then just follow that path per</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/152-4
00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:35.109
<v Malik, Hassan>se.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/154-0
00:18:35.109 --> 00:18:40.184
<v Malik, Hassan>I think you know they will. They'll need,
they'll need to have a bunch of detail</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/151-0
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.269
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/156-0
00:18:39.189 --> 00:18:42.889
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Absolutely, absolutely, yes.
So while initially we'll have to come</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/154-1
00:18:40.184 --> 00:18:42.189
<v Malik, Hassan>here. You know requirement, Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/153-0
00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:42.189
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/156-1
00:18:42.889 --> 00:18:47.140
<v Kumawat, Jaya>with the standardized requirements,
once we have reached a stable stage with</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/156-2
00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.061
<v Kumawat, Jaya>the standardized requirements,
we can then further move into the phase</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/156-3
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:53.269
<v Kumawat, Jaya>two,
which is the configurations you're</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/156-4
00:18:53.269 --> 00:18:54.429
<v Kumawat, Jaya>talking about, Hasan.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/155-0
00:18:56.589 --> 00:18:56.749
<v Malik, Hassan>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/157-0
00:19:01.189 --> 00:19:01.269
<v Miller, Jeremy>So.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/158-0
00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:05.516
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Launch Excellence.
We want to understand the early adopters</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/158-1
00:19:05.516 --> 00:19:09.372
<v Kumawat, Jaya>for the brand,
the mid adopters and the late laggards,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/158-2
00:19:09.372 --> 00:19:14.630
<v Kumawat, Jaya>as in we have a brand in the market and
we want to know who are the first,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/158-3
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:19.678
<v Kumawat, Jaya>let's say decile or first top 10
physicians we can reach out to for our</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/158-4
00:19:19.678 --> 00:19:20.029
<v Kumawat, Jaya>drug.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/159-0
00:19:20.989 --> 00:19:26.113
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Which is in the market and then who are
the ones we reach on later on.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/159-1
00:19:26.113 --> 00:19:31.887
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So this is like segregating your targeted
physicians by earlier doctors for the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/159-2
00:19:31.887 --> 00:19:35.568
<v Kumawat, Jaya>treatment and the late laggards for the
treatment.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/159-3
00:19:35.568 --> 00:19:40.909
<v Kumawat, Jaya>And I think Sunil will take this up
further in the prototype that he has.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/161-0
00:19:41.429 --> 00:19:46.747
<v Kumawat, Jaya>We do have additional use cases which is
switch opportunity and trigger alerts.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/161-1
00:19:46.747 --> 00:19:51.933
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Then we have HCP targeting for patient
identification and access driven label</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/161-2
00:19:51.933 --> 00:19:55.124
<v Kumawat, Jaya>expansions.
All these are very comprehensive in</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/161-3
00:19:55.124 --> 00:19:58.448
<v Kumawat, Jaya>themselves.
For 18th of December we are targeting</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/161-4
00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.309
<v Kumawat, Jaya>these first three use cases.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/162-0
00:20:00.509 --> 00:20:04.178
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Only so I I I wouldn't want to take the
remaining three.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/162-1
00:20:04.178 --> 00:20:07.460
<v Kumawat, Jaya>We can of course talk about it at some
other time.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/162-2
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Shall we look at the prototype for the
first three, Hassan and Jeremy?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/162-3
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:16.985
<v Kumawat, Jaya>And then maybe Sunil can get into the
data entities required for these three</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/162-4
00:20:16.985 --> 00:20:17.629
<v Kumawat, Jaya>use cases.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/165-0
00:20:17.069 --> 00:20:22.361
<v Malik, Hassan>Sorry, the three use cases by December,
I don't think it's real estate friendly</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/163-0
00:20:21.749 --> 00:20:23.989
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/165-1
00:20:22.361 --> 00:20:25.999
<v Malik, Hassan>at all. OK,
so that would be my very initial feedback.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/165-2
00:20:25.999 --> 00:20:30.629
<v Malik, Hassan>I mean there is quite a bit of
requirements work that needs to happen</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/164-0
00:20:30.189 --> 00:20:31.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Mm-hmm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/165-3
00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:32.349
<v Malik, Hassan>here that will need to be.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/169-0
00:20:32.629 --> 00:20:36.700
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, we need, you know,
even just connecting all this data</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/169-1
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.179
<v Malik, Hassan>properly and normalizing it, et cetera,
will will take some time.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/166-0
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:37.989
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/169-2
00:20:41.179 --> 00:20:46.675
<v Malik, Hassan>We will need to find a way to fund this
stuff. None of this is funded right now.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/168-0
00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:41.629
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/169-3
00:20:46.675 --> 00:20:51.629
<v Malik, Hassan>So I want to have very clear expectations,
right? So they're all doable.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/171-0
00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:56.506
<v Malik, Hassan>I I you know I I don't see any
substantial issues with you know but you</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/170-0
00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:57.269
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah, they're all doable for sure, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/171-1
00:20:56.506 --> 00:21:01.836
<v Malik, Hassan>know everything you know everything from
defining from you know the the the the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/171-2
00:21:01.836 --> 00:21:07.365
<v Malik, Hassan>the data the impact you know these these
events their configurability you know for</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/171-3
00:21:07.365 --> 00:21:11.629
<v Malik, Hassan>whatever that happens to be you know that
we'll need to define.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/172-0
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:16.549
<v Malik, Hassan>Evaluation criteria have time for at
least some level of reasonable testing.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/173-0
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:19.549
<v Malik, Hassan>The timelines are not realistic.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/174-0
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:22.201
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, yeah.
And I think there's an opportunity here</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/174-1
00:21:22.201 --> 00:21:27.015
<v Miller, Jeremy>for us to work together better as well,
because this is the first time I'm seeing</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/174-2
00:21:27.015 --> 00:21:31.828
<v Miller, Jeremy>the stack and I frankly should have been
involved at the time that this was being</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/174-3
00:21:31.828 --> 00:21:34.469
<v Miller, Jeremy>drafted.
Maybe not at the very early stages,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/174-4
00:21:34.469 --> 00:21:38.989
<v Miller, Jeremy>but at the time we started writing things
down, having me in the room is an.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/177-0
00:21:39.189 --> 00:21:39.629
<v Miller, Jeremy>Minister.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/178-0
00:21:39.629 --> 00:21:42.205
<v Miller, Jeremy>Everyone,
because it helps us come up with a</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/178-1
00:21:42.205 --> 00:21:46.842
<v Miller, Jeremy>realistic sense of what's the size of
something, how much work is it gonna take,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/178-2
00:21:46.842 --> 00:21:50.162
<v Miller, Jeremy>broadly speaking,
and it's a little bit of a failure mode</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/178-3
00:21:50.162 --> 00:21:53.883
<v Miller, Jeremy>to have a product team.
And this isn't a comment about you guys.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/178-4
00:21:53.883 --> 00:21:57.718
<v Miller, Jeremy>This happens a lot of times,
but a product team create a road map,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/176-0
00:21:57.509 --> 00:21:57.709
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/178-5
00:21:57.718 --> 00:21:59.149
<v Miller, Jeremy>not talk to data science.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/180-0
00:21:59.789 --> 00:22:02.324
<v Miller, Jeremy>Some dates and then they come to us and
we just say, well,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/180-1
00:22:02.324 --> 00:22:05.718
<v Miller, Jeremy>I mean that the dates don't make any
sense because we weren't in the room when</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/179-0
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:05.109
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/180-2
00:22:05.718 --> 00:22:09.069
<v Miller, Jeremy>we had the discussion about like what it
might take to actually do something.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/184-0
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:13.147
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Jeremy, the day I got,
we got to know we were pointed to you and</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/184-1
00:22:13.147 --> 00:22:17.822
<v Kumawat, Jaya>to Hassan. I think we got this set up.
It was just that in the middle I was</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/184-2
00:22:17.822 --> 00:22:20.774
<v Kumawat, Jaya>traveling to Delhi because of which I
couldn't.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/181-0
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:19.949
<v Malik, Hassan>OK, that's it.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/182-0
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:21.029
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/184-3
00:22:20.774 --> 00:22:24.649
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I had to cancel the day I traveled that
day itself. I said it.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/184-4
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:28.709
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I would have loved to have this meeting
with you and with Hassan.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/183-0
00:22:28.069 --> 00:22:30.469
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, no, look, it's it's OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/189-0
00:22:28.829 --> 00:22:33.652
<v Kumawat, Jaya>We did have the conversation. Yeah,
we had the conversations with Raghu.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/187-0
00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:33.885
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah,
it's it's an opportunity for us to work</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/185-0
00:22:32.109 --> 00:22:32.989
<v Malik, Hassan>But it.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/189-1
00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:39.004
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I had multiple conversations with Raghu
with Imran before I finally put the date</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/187-1
00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:34.949
<v Miller, Jeremy>better. Yeah, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/186-0
00:22:34.629 --> 00:22:34.949
<v Malik, Hassan>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/189-2
00:22:39.004 --> 00:22:42.241
<v Kumawat, Jaya>on the road map.
I would have loved to have this</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/189-3
00:22:42.241 --> 00:22:46.469
<v Kumawat, Jaya>conversation with you, Hassan and Jeremy.
Nonetheless, it's OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/189-4
00:22:46.469 --> 00:22:47.989
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Better late than never.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/190-0
00:22:48.349 --> 00:22:51.149
<v Kumawat, Jaya>That's where product development happens.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/188-0
00:22:48.429 --> 00:22:49.069
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, for sure.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/192-0
00:22:48.629 --> 00:22:52.364
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, so so look,
here is what I would recommend, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/192-1
00:22:52.364 --> 00:22:57.344
<v Malik, Hassan>Instead of trying to push through three
use cases and then deliver nothing,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/192-2
00:22:57.344 --> 00:23:01.865
<v Malik, Hassan>I would suggest picking one, you know,
two. So, so, so give me this,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/191-0
00:22:58.869 --> 00:22:59.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Hmm, OK, OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/192-3
00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:05.469
<v Malik, Hassan>just just be strategic, right?
So pick the one that's.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/194-0
00:23:05.789 --> 00:23:11.213
<v Malik, Hassan>That have the highest impact and the low.
So here's what I recommend.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/194-1
00:23:11.213 --> 00:23:16.559
<v Malik, Hassan>So the next we only have 6 minutes.
So spend a few hours with Jeremy</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/193-0
00:23:15.229 --> 00:23:17.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/194-2
00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:20.510
<v Malik, Hassan>separately.
Dive deep into each of these three use</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/194-3
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:25.469
<v Malik, Hassan>cases with a goal of getting out of that
meeting or soon after.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/195-0
00:23:25.469 --> 00:23:30.371
<v Malik, Hassan>So making a determination on the level of
complexity and effort and then the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/195-1
00:23:30.371 --> 00:23:35.464
<v Malik, Hassan>overall business impact and pick one use
case that has the least effort and the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/195-2
00:23:35.464 --> 00:23:39.283
<v Malik, Hassan>highest business impact, right.
So that combination per se,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/195-3
00:23:39.283 --> 00:23:43.230
<v Malik, Hassan>but even if the lowest business impact is
substantial enough,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/195-4
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.949
<v Malik, Hassan>but the effort is very low.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/197-0
00:23:45.589 --> 00:23:50.249
<v Malik, Hassan>So pick that one and really focus on
building a very good POC that can be</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/197-1
00:23:50.249 --> 00:23:53.586
<v Malik, Hassan>quickly productionized after in this time
frame. So,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/196-0
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.269
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/197-2
00:23:53.586 --> 00:23:57.491
<v Malik, Hassan>so two months is actually not completely
unreasonable, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/197-3
00:23:57.491 --> 00:24:01.269
<v Malik, Hassan>So for building something 3 use cases in
the current state.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/199-0
00:24:01.629 --> 00:24:05.542
<v Malik, Hassan>Not realistic, right?
Pick one high impact one and start</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/198-0
00:24:03.749 --> 00:24:04.229
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/199-1
00:24:05.542 --> 00:24:10.691
<v Malik, Hassan>defining it and in parallel we'll have to
go and have a conversation with.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/199-2
00:24:10.691 --> 00:24:15.634
<v Malik, Hassan>I'll probably have to talk to Chris and
Andy, etc. How do we fund this?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/199-3
00:24:15.634 --> 00:24:20.096
<v Malik, Hassan>How do we resource this, etc.
What can we deprioritize for them?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/199-4
00:24:20.096 --> 00:24:21.469
<v Malik, Hassan>Because the team is.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/202-0
00:24:21.469 --> 00:24:24.962
<v Malik, Hassan>Working on a very large number of
initiatives,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/200-0
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:25.429
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/202-1
00:24:24.962 --> 00:24:30.611
<v Malik, Hassan>all and all the stakeholders that have
asked us to work on those have equal</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/202-2
00:24:30.611 --> 00:24:36.112
<v Malik, Hassan>excitement about them, let's say.
So we'll need to make some decisions on</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/201-0
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:35.029
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/202-3
00:24:36.112 --> 00:24:39.457
<v Malik, Hassan>the prior test.
So that's a parallel effort,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/202-4
00:24:39.457 --> 00:24:40.869
<v Malik, Hassan>but and as soon as.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/205-0
00:24:41.109 --> 00:24:44.292
<v Malik, Hassan>First one is underway.
My recommendation will be start defining</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/205-1
00:24:44.292 --> 00:24:47.127
<v Malik, Hassan>the other two in much more detail and
come up with time,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/203-0
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:46.389
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/204-0
00:24:46.829 --> 00:24:47.429
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/205-2
00:24:47.127 --> 00:24:48.669
<v Malik, Hassan>you know time for those, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/206-0
00:24:47.949 --> 00:24:51.996
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Absolutely, Hassan, absolutely,
completely aligned with you.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/206-1
00:24:51.996 --> 00:24:57.304
<v Kumawat, Jaya>And the discussions that Sameer and I,
we have had there totally on the similar</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/206-2
00:24:57.304 --> 00:25:01.949
<v Kumawat, Jaya>lines as you just mentioned. Yeah,
it's not funded for 2025, I agree.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/206-3
00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:04.669
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Sameer and I, we're trying to figure out.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/208-0
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:12.173
<v Kumawat, Jaya>How to get whatever we can get resources
bandwidth for 2025? It's funded for 2026,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/208-1
00:25:12.173 --> 00:25:15.789
<v Kumawat, Jaya>but for 2025 it's not. You're right, so.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/207-0
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.189
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/211-0
00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:18.383
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep. Yeah. So we can look. So.
So I think it doesn't mean that a lot of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/211-1
00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:21.042
<v Malik, Hassan>definition work cannot happen. Also,
you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/209-0
00:25:18.469 --> 00:25:18.709
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Sure.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/210-0
00:25:20.869 --> 00:25:20.989
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/211-2
00:25:21.042 --> 00:25:25.398
<v Malik, Hassan>I'll of course I'm I cannot guarantee,
but I'll go and see if there are some</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/211-3
00:25:25.398 --> 00:25:29.189
<v Malik, Hassan>things in this time frame and and and by
the way, meaningful work.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/214-0
00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:33.790
<v Malik, Hassan>Generally have start after at least some
level of detailed definition, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/214-1
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.502
<v Malik, Hassan>So we're talking at least a few weeks
here, so so spend that time.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/212-0
00:25:34.109 --> 00:25:34.469
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/214-2
00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:40.605
<v Malik, Hassan>In the meantime,
I will go and see if there is anything</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/213-0
00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:38.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Oh.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/214-3
00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:45.037
<v Malik, Hassan>else in the pipeline that will not get
substantially hurt by just delaying it a</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/214-4
00:25:45.037 --> 00:25:48.029
<v Malik, Hassan>little bit and OK,
can I find one person for example?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/216-0
00:25:48.349 --> 00:25:52.995
<v Malik, Hassan>That can come and start prototyping and
start doing something here. I know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/216-1
00:25:52.995 --> 00:25:56.785
<v Malik, Hassan>you know, of course it's not funded,
right? But we, you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/215-0
00:25:53.949 --> 00:25:54.069
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/216-2
00:25:56.785 --> 00:26:00.820
<v Malik, Hassan>we don't get get that, you know,
don't let that become, you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/216-3
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.938
<v Malik, Hassan>a showstopper.
So we'll try to find some bandwidth</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/216-4
00:26:03.938 --> 00:26:04.549
<v Malik, Hassan>somewhere.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/219-0
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:09.202
<v Malik, Hassan>That I'll take that action item, right,
that someone that can come and start</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/219-1
00:26:09.202 --> 00:26:11.655
<v Malik, Hassan>helping us. But even that really,
you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/219-2
00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:15.502
<v Malik, Hassan>requires an understanding of the use case.
Which one are we picking?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/219-3
00:26:15.502 --> 00:26:18.066
<v Malik, Hassan>Because the skill sets may be very
different,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/217-0
00:26:15.709 --> 00:26:16.789
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yes, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/219-4
00:26:18.066 --> 00:26:21.969
<v Malik, Hassan>like some may require a scientist
building a model, some may require,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/219-5
00:26:21.969 --> 00:26:24.589
<v Malik, Hassan>let's say, MLE, right, that can, you know,
do.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/218-0
00:26:24.589 --> 00:26:25.829
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/221-0
00:26:25.109 --> 00:26:28.947
<v Malik, Hassan>Quite a bit of work and get it to a
decent state.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/221-1
00:26:28.947 --> 00:26:34.628
<v Malik, Hassan>So so yeah that the please you know find
a few hours as soon as possible.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/221-2
00:26:34.628 --> 00:26:40.309
<v Malik, Hassan>I would say you know within the next one
or two days with Jeremy and and.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/220-0
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:40.909
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/222-0
00:26:40.869 --> 00:26:41.109
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/223-0
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:46.636
<v Kumawat, Jaya>No, appreciate.
Appreciate all your suggestions and input,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/223-1
00:26:46.636 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Hassan. This has been very valuable.
So I think we'll find another 60 minutes</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/223-2
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:58.109
<v Kumawat, Jaya>with Jeremy tomorrow to run in because
Sevil has created very comprehensive.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/224-0
00:26:58.309 --> 00:27:04.559
<v Kumawat, Jaya>PRD and detailed data specifications as
in he has absolutely pointed from which</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/224-1
00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:09.793
<v Kumawat, Jaya>data set which field we need.
So I think providing details to that</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/224-2
00:27:09.793 --> 00:27:13.309
<v Kumawat, Jaya>extent should help us with getting this
out.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/225-0
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:20.309
<v Kumawat, Jaya>In and out in the time frame,
what is possible and yes, Hassan.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/226-0
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:26.189
<v Kumawat, Jaya>We'll try and scope it out and see what
we can deliver by 18 December.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/228-0
00:27:26.829 --> 00:27:31.395
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So do we want to do the prototype today
because we've got another two minutes</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/227-0
00:27:26.869 --> 00:27:27.309
<v Malik, Hassan>Perfect.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/228-1
00:27:31.395 --> 00:27:33.912
<v Kumawat, Jaya>only?
Or shall we do the demo and the data</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/228-2
00:27:33.912 --> 00:27:38.302
<v Kumawat, Jaya>discussions in the next 60 minutes that
Sunil puts up on our calendars for</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/228-3
00:27:38.302 --> 00:27:38.829

<v Miller, Jeremy>So, so sorry, I want to ask, sorry,
I want to ask one question while we're</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/245-1
00:28:26.997 --> 00:28:30.839
<v Miller, Jeremy>still talking about the kind of broader
scope discussion.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/244-0
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:28.629
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Mhm, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/245-2
00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:36.138
<v Miller, Jeremy>So you I think I heard you say early on
in the discussion that this in this use</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/245-3
00:28:36.138 --> 00:28:38.589
<v Miller, Jeremy>case is our you're already solved it.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/246-0
00:28:38.949 --> 00:28:41.617
<v Miller, Jeremy>Using non machine learning methods,
is that right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/246-1
00:28:41.617 --> 00:28:45.749
<v Miller, Jeremy>Or is this something that you want our
help building? That wasn't clear to me.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/247-0
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:48.537
<v Kumawat, Jaya>This does, yeah, this should.
This is typical descriptive analytics,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/247-1
00:28:48.537 --> 00:28:52.389
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Jeremy. So it will not need machine. Yes,
you you heard it right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/248-0
00:28:49.189 --> 00:28:52.359
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK,
so data science doesn't need to worry</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/248-1
00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:53.869
<v Miller, Jeremy>about this use case.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/250-0
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:58.767
<v Kumawat, Jaya>You're right, yes, yes, yeah.

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/249-0
00:28:54.949 --> 00:28:55.989
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK, great. OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/250-1
00:28:58.767 --> 00:29:04.528
<v Kumawat, Jaya>module is this is basic and fundamental
to every all the other specialized</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/250-2
00:29:04.528 --> 00:29:09.829
<v Kumawat, Jaya>modules I've been talking about as in
this provides the preliminary.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/251-0
00:29:18.949 --> 00:29:19.269
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/252-0
00:29:19.309 --> 00:29:19.989
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/253-0
00:29:19.309 --> 00:29:21.149
<v Kumawat, Jaya>That we have in INT.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/254-0
00:29:21.629 --> 00:29:22.309
<v Miller, Jeremy>Understood.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/255-0
00:29:24.069 --> 00:29:27.429
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK, great. So Sunil,
you wanna take the screen?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/256-0
00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:29.509
<v Rout, Sunil>Sure, absolutely. OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/257-0
00:29:29.109 --> 00:29:31.069
<v Kumawat, Jaya>And I've stopped to share.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/259-0
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:36.679
<v Rout, Sunil>Sure, yeah. OK.
So I can walk you through basically the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/259-1
00:29:36.679 --> 00:29:42.821
<v Rout, Sunil>prototype first and maybe then discuss
the data required for the all the KPIs</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/259-2
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:47.389
<v Rout, Sunil>and the metrics whatever I'm showing over
this prototype.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/260-0
00:29:47.829 --> 00:29:52.668
<v Rout, Sunil>So as Jay mentioned, right,
the first one is the high impact</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/260-1
00:29:52.668 --> 00:29:58.617
<v Rout, Sunil>prescriber and we can take an example of
a product which is Opdivo, right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/260-2
00:29:58.617 --> 00:30:04.804
<v Rout, Sunil>And we want to see how the Opdivo is
basically performing in the market first</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/260-3
00:30:04.804 --> 00:30:06.629
<v Rout, Sunil>in the first couple of.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/261-0
00:30:07.989 --> 00:30:12.417
<v Rout, Sunil>Overview basically.
So it will tell us what is the total</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/261-1
00:30:12.417 --> 00:30:17.312
<v Rout, Sunil>prescription of Opdivo.
Basically from I I have taken the data</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/261-2
00:30:17.312 --> 00:30:22.751
<v Rout, Sunil>from 2023 to 2025 September.
So it will and it this this is basically</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/261-3
00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:24.149
<v Rout, Sunil>our dummy data so.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/263-0
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:28.757
<v Rout, Sunil>When we connect the real data,
this number might change.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/263-1
00:30:28.757 --> 00:30:33.315
<v Rout, Sunil>So this will tell you the total
prescription of that particular product</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/263-2
00:30:33.315 --> 00:30:37.050
<v Rout, Sunil>and what is the total patients on that
particular product,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/263-3
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:40.469
<v Rout, Sunil>number of NPIs and the top decile NPIs
and number of.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/264-0
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:45.636
<v Rout, Sunil>NP is who are having favorable access.
When I say favorable access,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/264-1
00:30:45.636 --> 00:30:50.625
<v Rout, Sunil>how many NP is don't have any
restrictions or step therapy associated</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/264-2
00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:55.757
<v Rout, Sunil>with the patient's pair implants.
So that is why the market access data</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/264-3
00:30:55.757 --> 00:30:59.749
<v Rout, Sunil>comes into picture and it will give the
information of.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/265-0
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:05.436
<v Rout, Sunil>The favorable access or rested access in
the patient's plans and their</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/265-1
00:31:05.436 --> 00:31:06.309
<v Rout, Sunil>informations.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/267-0
00:31:06.109 --> 00:31:10.949
<v Malik, Hassan>Sorry, I'm a little confused here.
So I thought the use case was it's a new</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/267-1
00:31:10.949 --> 00:31:15.980
<v Malik, Hassan>drug that's going to be launched, right?
And for that we are going to look for</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/267-2
00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.629
<v Malik, Hassan>drugs that are similar in that therapy
area and find prescribers, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/266-0
00:31:19.229 --> 00:31:19.349
<v Rout, Sunil>So.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/270-0
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:26.112
<v Rout, Sunil>So basically it can be,
it can be for the existing product. Yeah,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/268-0
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:23.749
<v Malik, Hassan>So when?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/269-0
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:25.509
<v Kumawat, Jaya>It can. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Sorry. Sorry.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/270-1
00:31:26.112 --> 00:31:30.060
<v Rout, Sunil>sorry to interrupt.
So it can be for existing product and for</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/270-2
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.963
<v Rout, Sunil>the new products. So for existing product,
I just want to see how my drug is</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/270-3
00:31:34.963 --> 00:31:39.484
<v Rout, Sunil>performing in the market, right?
And if I want to launch a drug in the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/270-4
00:31:39.484 --> 00:31:40.949
<v Rout, Sunil>market, I in the first.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/272-0
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:44.345
<v Rout, Sunil>Few months I want to see how my drugs is
performing.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/272-1
00:31:44.345 --> 00:31:49.289
<v Rout, Sunil>So it is it can be for a existing product
which is there in the market from quite</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/272-2
00:31:49.289 --> 00:31:53.931
<v Rout, Sunil>long time or it will be basically a
product which is just launched and about</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/272-3
00:31:53.931 --> 00:31:57.549
<v Rout, Sunil>to pick in the market or having the
adoption in the market.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/274-0
00:31:57.589 --> 00:32:01.487
<v Kumawat, Jaya>The third use case could be you want to
look at the competitor landscape for your</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/271-0
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:59.069
<v Malik, Hassan>No.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/273-0
00:32:00.589 --> 00:32:02.029
<v Rout, Sunil>Absolutely, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/276-0
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:04.469
<v Malik, Hassan>But, but look,
so this is like a spray and pray type of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/274-1
00:32:01.487 --> 00:32:03.389
<v Kumawat, Jaya>product, how your product is performing.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/276-1
00:32:04.469 --> 00:32:09.135
<v Malik, Hassan>thing, right. So, so, so, so,
so this becomes very reactive instead of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/276-2
00:32:09.135 --> 00:32:14.063
<v Malik, Hassan>proactive which substantially reduces the
power. So if it's a new product,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/275-0
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:14.029
<v Rout, Sunil>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/276-3
00:32:14.063 --> 00:32:18.992
<v Malik, Hassan>so basically you know you don't it
assumes that whatever marketing has you</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/276-4
00:32:18.992 --> 00:32:20.109
<v Malik, Hassan>know happened to.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/280-0
00:32:20.309 --> 00:32:25.207
<v Malik, Hassan>Prescribers already happened, right?
So the big opportunity is gone already</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/280-1
00:32:25.207 --> 00:32:30.364
<v Malik, Hassan>and now they are seeing how whatever they
have done is impacting the market and</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/280-2
00:32:30.364 --> 00:32:33.973
<v Malik, Hassan>then they will be going back and making
changes, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/280-3
00:32:33.973 --> 00:32:38.549
<v Malik, Hassan>But when you launch a new product,
the very first thing is who do you?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/278-0
00:32:37.869 --> 00:32:38.109
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/284-0
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:44.335
<v Malik, Hassan>To reach out to before it's launched that
can or at the time of it's launch that</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/279-0
00:32:42.429 --> 00:32:42.749
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/284-1
00:32:44.335 --> 00:32:47.722
<v Malik, Hassan>can start prescribing.
So there is actually one thing that we</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/281-0
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.549
<v Rout, Sunil>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/284-2
00:32:47.722 --> 00:32:50.727
<v Malik, Hassan>have already built that can really come
in handy here.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/282-0
00:32:50.349 --> 00:32:50.829
<v Rout, Sunil>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/284-3
00:32:50.727 --> 00:32:54.989
<v Malik, Hassan>So we have this thing called drug analog
which is built on a knowledge graph.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/283-0
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:55.869
<v Rout, Sunil>Right, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/286-0
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:59.862
<v Malik, Hassan>And and and what it does is you can take
a drug or characteristics of a drug,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/286-1
00:32:59.862 --> 00:33:04.219
<v Malik, Hassan>right. So even if it's a brand,
you know and it will give you top K drugs</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/286-2
00:33:04.219 --> 00:33:07.399
<v Malik, Hassan>in that same therapy area that are
similar to it. OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/286-3
00:33:07.399 --> 00:33:11.109
<v Malik, Hassan>So that's a service that's actually about
to go to production.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/285-0
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:12.109
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/289-0
00:33:12.589 --> 00:33:16.797
<v Malik, Hassan>So you can what you can do here very
easily is you can for this new drug</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/289-1
00:33:16.797 --> 00:33:20.543
<v Malik, Hassan>connect with that API,
pull a list of those similar drugs first,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/287-0
00:33:19.189 --> 00:33:20.989
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Thank you. Thank you.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/289-2
00:33:20.543 --> 00:33:24.289
<v Malik, Hassan>right? So your top five,
top three or whatever similar drugs and</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/289-3
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:27.229
<v Malik, Hassan>then find high impact prescribers for
those drugs.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/288-0
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:28.989
<v Rout, Sunil>Correct. Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/293-0
00:33:27.869 --> 00:33:30.702
<v Malik, Hassan>OK.
And once you do that you will basically</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/293-1
00:33:30.702 --> 00:33:34.500
<v Malik, Hassan>have you know and and and and then you
run it on this. So,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/293-2
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:39.457
<v Malik, Hassan>so it will say for this right go and
target these you know high prescribers.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/293-3
00:33:39.457 --> 00:33:44.736
<v Malik, Hassan>So it becomes very you know seamless and
smooth and it adds a lot of value rather</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/291-0
00:33:40.349 --> 00:33:40.509
<v Rout, Sunil>Right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/290-0
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.269
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/293-4
00:33:44.736 --> 00:33:46.989
<v Malik, Hassan>than reactive it becomes proactive.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/292-0
00:33:45.309 --> 00:33:45.629
<v Rout, Sunil>Correct.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/294-0
00:33:47.229 --> 00:33:50.271
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah.
So basically it is for the analog studies.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/294-1
00:33:50.271 --> 00:33:54.741
<v Rout, Sunil>So if you see the brand launch excellence,
that's exactly we have done.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/294-2
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:59.397
<v Rout, Sunil>So we will do the analog studies,
right and we will see if a drug is going</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/294-3
00:33:59.397 --> 00:34:02.874
<v Rout, Sunil>to launch in the market,
who will be my early adopters,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/294-4
00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:05.109
<v Rout, Sunil>lead laggards and the basically the.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/297-0
00:34:05.349 --> 00:34:08.820
<v Rout, Sunil>Mainstream adapters.
So we have taken all the basically both</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/297-1
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.837
<v Rout, Sunil>the use cases,
but yeah to finalize the what are the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/297-2
00:34:11.837 --> 00:34:15.820
<v Rout, Sunil>analog drugs we have to take into
consideration that might be helpful</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/297-3
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.373
<v Rout, Sunil>basically to understand what are the top
five drugs we have to consider and see</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/295-0
00:34:19.189 --> 00:34:19.549
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/297-4
00:34:20.373 --> 00:34:24.869
<v Rout, Sunil>who are the high impact prescriber,
what is their prescribing pattern so that.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/296-0
00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:25.429
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/298-0
00:34:25.189 --> 00:34:28.750
<v Rout, Sunil>Basically,
I can go and target my physician to</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/298-1
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.189
<v Rout, Sunil>prescribe my brand.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/304-0
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:33.091
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah,
and you can look even for existing ones,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/299-0
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:33.189
<v Rout, Sunil>Absolutely.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/304-1
00:34:33.091 --> 00:34:36.337
<v Malik, Hassan>right? You can add another graph here,
another view. So, so,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/304-2
00:34:36.337 --> 00:34:40.382
<v Malik, Hassan>so there is one that and and this
actually can be done very quickly because</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/300-0
00:34:36.549 --> 00:34:37.149
<v Rout, Sunil>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/304-3
00:34:40.382 --> 00:34:43.682
<v Malik, Hassan>of what you have built and what we have
already built, right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/304-4
00:34:43.682 --> 00:34:47.461
<v Malik, Hassan>So just by just by integrating. So,
so basically show how this drug is</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/304-5
00:34:47.461 --> 00:34:50.229
<v Malik, Hassan>performing, right.
That's this graph that you have.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/301-0
00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:49.949
<v Rout, Sunil>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/308-0
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.491
<v Malik, Hassan>Per SE.
But then there can be another one that</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/302-0
00:34:51.029 --> 00:34:51.309
<v Rout, Sunil>Correct.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/308-1
00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:57.253
<v Malik, Hassan>says, you know,
here are the top prescribers for similar</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/303-0
00:34:53.789 --> 00:34:54.149
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/308-2
00:34:57.253 --> 00:35:00.883
<v Malik, Hassan>drugs, right?
And then when you add that and that list</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/305-0
00:34:59.989 --> 00:35:01.949
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah, OK. Yeah, so.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/308-3
00:35:00.883 --> 00:35:04.513
<v Malik, Hassan>is different,
then that becomes your target, you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/308-4
00:35:04.513 --> 00:35:07.747
<v Malik, Hassan>and that would add add substantial value,
right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/306-0
00:35:05.789 --> 00:35:06.749
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/308-5
00:35:07.747 --> 00:35:10.189
<v Malik, Hassan>Because because this work is obvious.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/307-0
00:35:08.749 --> 00:35:09.069
<v Rout, Sunil>Correct.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/309-0
00:35:10.309 --> 00:35:14.080
<v Malik, Hassan>That one is not right.
That there's a lot of, lot of people,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/311-0
00:35:10.549 --> 00:35:15.213
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes, yeah, yeah. So basically correct.
So right now we have the anchor therapy.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/309-1
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:14.389
<v Malik, Hassan>yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/311-1
00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:19.760
<v Rout, Sunil>So we can add the comparison therapy to
compare how the computer is basically</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/311-2
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.325
<v Rout, Sunil>working,
who are the top prescriber in that</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/311-3
00:35:22.325 --> 00:35:25.590
<v Rout, Sunil>particular comparison therapy versus my
anchor therapy.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/311-4
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:30.429
<v Rout, Sunil>So there is a plan basically in the phase
two where we have to add the comparison.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/310-0
00:35:26.389 --> 00:35:26.749
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/312-0
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:34.135
<v Rout, Sunil>Therapy to compare my product versus the
computer product,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/312-1
00:35:34.135 --> 00:35:38.702
<v Rout, Sunil>my prescriber versus the prescriber
compare prescribing the computer brand.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/312-2
00:35:38.702 --> 00:35:42.669
<v Rout, Sunil>So that's the next phase of POC we are
trying to basically build.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/317-0
00:35:43.029 --> 00:35:46.152
<v Malik, Hassan>Cool. Yeah.
So this list on the right that you have</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/317-1
00:35:46.152 --> 00:35:49.215
<v Malik, Hassan>that can oh,
so so anchor therapy is the so define</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/317-2
00:35:49.215 --> 00:35:51.978
<v Malik, Hassan>anchor. So anchor is the query per se,
right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/313-0
00:35:49.269 --> 00:35:49.869
<v Rout, Sunil>Selected.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/317-3
00:35:51.978 --> 00:35:56.363
<v Malik, Hassan>Anchor is the one that the user is
interested in. OK, OK, so so so yeah,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/315-0
00:35:53.509 --> 00:35:56.229
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes, absolutely. Yes, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/314-0
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.669
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/317-4
00:35:56.363 --> 00:36:00.447
<v Malik, Hassan>that's also that can simply be the input
to the drug analog, right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/317-5
00:36:00.447 --> 00:36:02.549
<v Malik, Hassan>And that can it can give you top K.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/316-0
00:36:00.709 --> 00:36:01.909
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/322-0
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:07.070
<v Malik, Hassan>Drug with bunch of information that you
you can ignore the information but you</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/322-1
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.971
<v Malik, Hassan>just take the drugs right meeting certain
thresholds and Jeremy can help you</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/318-0
00:36:07.189 --> 00:36:07.869
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/322-2
00:36:10.971 --> 00:36:14.719
<v Malik, Hassan>connect with Luca who is leading that
initiative and you can just use the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/322-3
00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:17.505
<v Malik, Hassan>service right.
It's currently being built for clinical</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/322-4
00:36:17.505 --> 00:36:21.709
<v Malik, Hassan>about to go live in clinical and then you
yeah you you take that and you can just.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/319-0
00:36:18.669 --> 00:36:18.829
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/327-0
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:25.856
<v Malik, Hassan>Add a few graphs for it and deep dive
type of information and also make it</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/321-0
00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:25.109
<v Rout, Sunil>Sure, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/320-0
00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:24.109
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/327-1
00:36:25.856 --> 00:36:28.756
<v Malik, Hassan>interactive right?
So the drug analog can essentially</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/323-0
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.429
<v Rout, Sunil>Sure.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/327-2
00:36:28.756 --> 00:36:32.569
<v Malik, Hassan>recommend bunch of things and the user
show all them them to the user.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/327-3
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:36.542
<v Malik, Hassan>Maybe everything is selected by default
and you're pulling everything the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/324-0
00:36:35.509 --> 00:36:38.149
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah, makes sense.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/327-4
00:36:36.542 --> 00:36:40.194
<v Malik, Hassan>statistics and combining,
but the user is able to deselect and take</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/327-5
00:36:40.194 --> 00:36:41.429
<v Malik, Hassan>something out right or.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/325-0
00:36:41.029 --> 00:36:42.069
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah, that's.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/328-0
00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:46.524
<v Malik, Hassan>Or or add something else that they want
and it can be average of statistics or</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/326-0
00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:44.229
<v Rout, Sunil>Absolutely.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/328-1
00:36:46.524 --> 00:36:49.490
<v Malik, Hassan>the statistics by drug,
by a competitor drug,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/328-2
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.909
<v Malik, Hassan>right or similar drug.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/329-0
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:54.674
<v Rout, Sunil>OK. Yep, Yep. OK.
So then I just want to see how my total</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/329-1
00:36:54.674 --> 00:37:00.620
<v Rout, Sunil>prescription works and what are my new
prescription from the from the quarters</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/329-2
00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:06.416
<v Rout, Sunil>basically from 2023 to 2025 and how the
number of prescribers and the growth</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/329-3
00:37:06.416 --> 00:37:08.749
<v Rout, Sunil>looks like from last two years.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/331-0
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:13.368
<v Rout, Sunil>And this is basically the product
overview, right? But my main targeting,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/331-1
00:37:13.368 --> 00:37:16.822
<v Rout, Sunil>my main agenda is basically to see the
prescribing pattern,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/331-2
00:37:16.822 --> 00:37:20.851
<v Rout, Sunil>who are the prescriber, right?
So here the prescribers part coming to</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/331-3
00:37:20.851 --> 00:37:23.787
<v Rout, Sunil>picture.
So here I will see who are the top ranked</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/331-4
00:37:23.787 --> 00:37:27.989
<v Rout, Sunil>prescribers, what is their specialty,
what is their affiliation details.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/330-0
00:37:28.469 --> 00:37:28.989
<v Malik, Hassan>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/333-0
00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:33.531
<v Rout, Sunil>And what is the patient count and the RX
volume they have prescribed so far and</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/333-1
00:37:33.531 --> 00:37:37.443
<v Rout, Sunil>what is the growth rate?
So this will basically help me if I want</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/333-2
00:37:37.443 --> 00:37:42.362
<v Rout, Sunil>to target so I can add list to the target.
I can send this send this alert message</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/333-3
00:37:42.362 --> 00:37:45.267
<v Rout, Sunil>to the sales Rep and do maybe added this
to CRM,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/333-4
00:37:45.267 --> 00:37:48.349
<v Rout, Sunil>Viva CRM and then do the targeting for
the for the.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/334-0
00:37:48.629 --> 00:37:53.116
<v Rout, Sunil>Physician to the physician basically.
So this is basically a traditional way of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/332-0
00:37:49.149 --> 00:37:49.269
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/334-1
00:37:53.116 --> 00:37:57.099
<v Rout, Sunil>doing the commercial targeting,
but the only part we have added is the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/334-2
00:37:57.099 --> 00:38:01.249
<v Rout, Sunil>market access data because if we
integrate the market access data then we</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/334-3
00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:04.334
<v Rout, Sunil>will come to know let's say we have the
100 physician,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/334-4
00:38:04.334 --> 00:38:08.429
<v Rout, Sunil>but out of 100 physician only 30%
physician having the favorable access.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/335-0
00:38:08.549 --> 00:38:12.575
<v Rout, Sunil>That means there is a access barrier for
my particular brand, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/335-1
00:38:12.575 --> 00:38:17.244
<v Rout, Sunil>For that reason we have showing the US
favorable access by state in which state</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/335-2
00:38:17.244 --> 00:38:21.970
<v Rout, Sunil>my drug is performing very well and who
are the prescribers having the favorable</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/335-3
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:25.646
<v Rout, Sunil>access and what is the percent of the of
the favorable access.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/335-4
00:38:25.646 --> 00:38:28.389
<v Rout, Sunil>So if you see the state wise if I see in
them.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/336-0
00:38:28.669 --> 00:38:33.303
<v Rout, Sunil>Number of NPI counts, the RX volumes,
the patient count and the favorable</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/336-1
00:38:33.303 --> 00:38:37.059
<v Rout, Sunil>access percentage.
So it will tell me basically the reasons</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/336-2
00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:41.943
<v Rout, Sunil>or the state where my drug is performing
well and having favorable access and</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/336-3
00:38:41.943 --> 00:38:44.949
<v Rout, Sunil>where is my prescriber are basically
right now.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/338-0
00:38:45.509 --> 00:38:50.503
<v Rout, Sunil>So that is what we basically try to show
the high impact prescriber in this</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/338-1
00:38:50.503 --> 00:38:53.789
<v Rout, Sunil>particular module.
Any question Hassan or Jeremy?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/337-0
00:38:50.629 --> 00:38:51.069
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/342-0
00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:57.631
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yep, I have a pretty technical question,
but if you go down to the list of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/342-1
00:38:57.631 --> 00:39:00.665
<v Miller, Jeremy>prescribers,
so so I know this is a prototype,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/339-0
00:38:58.389 --> 00:38:59.109
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/340-0
00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:01.069
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/342-2
00:39:00.665 --> 00:39:04.925
<v Miller, Jeremy>but just thinking about what this might
look like if it was real,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/342-3
00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:09.896
<v Miller, Jeremy>where does this prescriber view live?
So the end the RWD is all at the event</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/342-4
00:39:09.896 --> 00:39:12.349
<v Miller, Jeremy>view, right? So there's a claim event.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/343-0
00:39:12.749 --> 00:39:15.473
<v Miller, Jeremy>There's a visit event or something like
that.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/341-0
00:39:13.429 --> 00:39:13.869
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/343-1
00:39:15.473 --> 00:39:20.446
<v Miller, Jeremy>So something has to do a pretty big group
by and aggregate with some business logic</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/343-2
00:39:20.446 --> 00:39:24.473
<v Miller, Jeremy>in there and make that available.
So is is that is there a plan to,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/343-3
00:39:24.473 --> 00:39:27.374
<v Miller, Jeremy>you know,
have that as a data source which feeds</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/343-4
00:39:27.374 --> 00:39:30.749
<v Miller, Jeremy>this and then which can then feed data
science services?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/344-0
00:39:31.189 --> 00:39:33.945
<v Miller, Jeremy>Or are you thinking to kind of do all
that on the fly,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/344-1
00:39:33.945 --> 00:39:35.949
<v Miller, Jeremy>which I think might be really difficult?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/347-0
00:39:36.469 --> 00:39:40.624
<v Kumawat, Jaya>No, Jeremy,
we're not planning to do this on the fly</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/345-0
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.869
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/347-1
00:39:40.624 --> 00:39:45.406
<v Kumawat, Jaya>because like I said,
we want to have a robust data strategy.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/347-2
00:39:45.406 --> 00:39:51.363
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I'm in conversations with Armahan,
Imran and Raghu on how to architect that</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/347-3
00:39:51.363 --> 00:39:52.069
<v Kumawat, Jaya>side and.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/346-0
00:39:51.549 --> 00:39:51.709
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/348-0
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:56.024
<v Kumawat, Jaya>When I had this conversation with Imran
today,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/348-1
00:39:56.024 --> 00:40:01.286
<v Kumawat, Jaya>he said that for some of the events that
you just talked about, Jeremy,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/348-2
00:40:01.286 --> 00:40:06.402
<v Kumawat, Jaya>there the rappers do exist,
but those event rappers currently do pull</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/348-3
00:40:06.402 --> 00:40:08.229
<v Kumawat, Jaya>for diagnosis treatments.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/349-0
00:40:08.269 --> 00:40:11.875
<v Kumawat, Jaya>And for,
but it doesn't pull for pull for NPIs.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/349-1
00:40:11.875 --> 00:40:16.534
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So that's an additional wrapper that
Imran will have to work.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/349-2
00:40:16.534 --> 00:40:20.065
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I'm not sure even after building that
wrapper,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/349-3
00:40:20.065 --> 00:40:24.949
<v Kumawat, Jaya>this serves our purpose because we're
trying to get a dedicated.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/351-0
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:32.316
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Data architect for this suite of products
because we ultimately are going to need</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/351-1
00:40:32.316 --> 00:40:38.556
<v Kumawat, Jaya>one single integrated data asset.
I don't think that exists right now.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/350-0
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.309
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/351-2
00:40:38.556 --> 00:40:44.709
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I am having conversations with some more
folks to understand if this.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/354-0
00:40:44.709 --> 00:40:47.142
<v Kumawat, Jaya>This integrated data exists.
If it doesn't,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/354-1
00:40:47.142 --> 00:40:50.018
<v Kumawat, Jaya>we're going to have to create one journey.
So yeah,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/354-2
00:40:50.018 --> 00:40:53.779
<v Kumawat, Jaya>to to answer your question precisely,
we don't have that right now,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/354-3
00:40:53.779 --> 00:40:56.765
<v Kumawat, Jaya>but we don't want to do it on the fly
either. I mean,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/352-0
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.429
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/354-4
00:40:56.765 --> 00:41:00.858
<v Kumawat, Jaya>we don't want to execute one query,
create 10 joins in the query and then</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/353-0
00:40:56.789 --> 00:40:58.149
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, alright.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/354-5
00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:03.789
<v Kumawat, Jaya>pull the data.
We don't want to do things like that.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/357-0
00:41:01.989 --> 00:41:04.904
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yep, Yep. Great.
I just want to make sure that we</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/355-0
00:41:03.989 --> 00:41:04.349
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/357-1
00:41:04.904 --> 00:41:09.393
<v Miller, Jeremy>understand that there's a significant
amount of work there just to make that</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/357-2
00:41:09.393 --> 00:41:10.909
<v Miller, Jeremy>data look like this, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/364-0
00:41:09.509 --> 00:41:15.254
<v Kumawat, Jaya>It's oh, it's a whole foundational work.
I think once we have the foundation,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/356-0
00:41:10.429 --> 00:41:10.509
<v Rout, Sunil>So.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/359-0
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:14.269
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK, great.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/358-0
00:41:13.629 --> 00:41:13.869
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/364-1
00:41:15.254 --> 00:41:21.221
<v Kumawat, Jaya>we can go on creating as many pop outs
out of that common data model as we want.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/360-0
00:41:15.429 --> 00:41:16.429
<v Miller, Jeremy>Great.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/361-0
00:41:20.429 --> 00:41:20.869
<v Miller, Jeremy>Excellent.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/362-0
00:41:20.989 --> 00:41:21.109
<v Malik, Hassan>Good.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/364-2
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:21.589
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Sure.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/365-0
00:41:23.029 --> 00:41:28.166
<v Rout, Sunil>OK, OK. Moving to the next module,
which is basically the market access pull</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/363-0
00:41:24.469 --> 00:41:24.829
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/365-1
00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:31.968
<v Rout, Sunil>through, right.
So here I just want to basically what is</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/365-2
00:41:31.968 --> 00:41:36.438
<v Rout, Sunil>the use case Ajay mentioned.
Basically we want to see if there's a</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/365-3
00:41:36.438 --> 00:41:39.707
<v Rout, Sunil>pair win,
but that pair win is not reflecting in</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/365-4
00:41:39.707 --> 00:41:42.509
<v Rout, Sunil>the data right for the product sales data.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/367-0
00:41:42.989 --> 00:41:48.042
<v Rout, Sunil>Or the prescribing data or maybe the
prior part is already there, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/367-1
00:41:48.042 --> 00:41:53.026
<v Rout, Sunil>And right now the prescriber are not
aware of the product market access</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/367-2
00:41:53.026 --> 00:41:58.425
<v Rout, Sunil>barriers, right? And prescribing it left,
right and center and the claims are</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/367-3
00:41:58.425 --> 00:42:02.509
<v Rout, Sunil>getting rejected, right?
So basically I just want to show.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/369-0
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:05.842
<v Rout, Sunil>So right,
how this particular brand is performing</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/366-0
00:42:03.429 --> 00:42:03.589
<v Miller, Jeremy>2.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/368-0
00:42:03.509 --> 00:42:03.549
<v Miller, Jeremy>Oh.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/369-1
00:42:05.842 --> 00:42:09.216
<v Rout, Sunil>right now in the market and what is the
access barrier.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/369-2
00:42:09.216 --> 00:42:13.916
<v Rout, Sunil>So if you see the rejection due to the
PNST for that particular brand, right,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/369-3
00:42:13.916 --> 00:42:18.737
<v Rout, Sunil>it's showing 17% is rejected for that
particular brand and the 19% are patients</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/369-4
00:42:18.737 --> 00:42:21.629
<v Rout, Sunil>are basically abandoning that particular
brand.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/371-0
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:26.583
<v Rout, Sunil>And then NPI having high restriction
network means the patients,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/371-1
00:42:26.583 --> 00:42:32.485
<v Rout, Sunil>the NPI who are writing those prescribing,
the prescribing those brand are basically</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/371-2
00:42:32.485 --> 00:42:37.832
<v Rout, Sunil>falling into lot of restriction like PAST
or quantity limitations or getting</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/371-3
00:42:37.832 --> 00:42:39.429
<v Rout, Sunil>rejected by the payers.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/372-0
00:42:39.909 --> 00:42:42.459
<v Rout, Sunil>So,
so this information will tell me about</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/372-1
00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:47.145
<v Rout, Sunil>how my the product is performing or is
there any access barrier attached to my</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/372-2
00:42:47.145 --> 00:42:50.586
<v Rout, Sunil>product as of now?
And because of that my access barrier,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/372-3
00:42:50.586 --> 00:42:54.678
<v Rout, Sunil>what is the rejection rate?
What is the abundant rate of my product,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/372-4
00:42:54.678 --> 00:42:57.051
<v Rout, Sunil>right?
And that that's what I have sold</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/372-5
00:42:57.051 --> 00:42:58.949
<v Rout, Sunil>basically in quarter by quarter.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/373-0
00:42:59.629 --> 00:43:05.025
<v Rout, Sunil>The rejection rate and abandonment rate,
but the the main agenda is basically to</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/373-1
00:43:05.025 --> 00:43:08.223
<v Rout, Sunil>show at the NPI level, right?
At the NPI level,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/373-2
00:43:08.223 --> 00:43:12.286
<v Rout, Sunil>who who are the NPI having the high API
burden score, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/373-3
00:43:12.286 --> 00:43:16.550
<v Rout, Sunil>Let's say the patient,
the prescriber is writing 100 claims out</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/373-4
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.749
<v Rout, Sunil>of the 100 claims.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/374-0
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:20.905
<v Rout, Sunil>70% claims is having,
let's say a PA burden,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/374-1
00:43:20.905 --> 00:43:24.801
<v Rout, Sunil>PA are attached to that particular plan
of the patients.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/374-2
00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:29.927
<v Rout, Sunil>So the burden is basically 70% and
because of the PA patient are basically</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/374-3
00:43:29.927 --> 00:43:34.712
<v Rout, Sunil>abandoned that particular product or
basically the claims are getting</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/374-4
00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:37.309
<v Rout, Sunil>abandoned, right? So it will tell you.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/375-0
00:43:37.629 --> 00:43:41.561
<v Rout, Sunil>You the PA burden score,
the rejection rate and the abundant rate</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/375-1
00:43:41.561 --> 00:43:45.374
<v Rout, Sunil>and it will also tell me the details of
the formularies, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/375-2
00:43:45.374 --> 00:43:50.378
<v Rout, Sunil>What are the formularies attached to that
particular physician where it is covered,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/375-3
00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:55.323
<v Rout, Sunil>where it is prior authorized and required
because it is basically a combination of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/375-4
00:43:55.323 --> 00:43:57.349
<v Rout, Sunil>the claims and market access data.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/376-0
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:59.761
<v Rout, Sunil>Right.
And we also get those information from</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/376-1
00:43:59.761 --> 00:44:03.693
<v Rout, Sunil>the clinical nodes to see if basically in
the clinical nodes if patient is</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/376-2
00:44:03.693 --> 00:44:07.626
<v Rout, Sunil>basically rejected or abandoned that
particular product because there is a</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/376-3
00:44:07.626 --> 00:44:11.768
<v Rout, Sunil>mention of a prior authorizations or
because of there is a mention of the high</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/376-4
00:44:11.768 --> 00:44:15.019
<v Rout, Sunil>co-pay impact, right.
So those basically we can get also from</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/376-5
00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:15.229
<v Rout, Sunil>the.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/378-0
00:44:15.509 --> 00:44:19.592
<v Rout, Sunil>Clinical nodes and we are planning to
integrate both clinical nodes,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/378-1
00:44:19.592 --> 00:44:24.268
<v Rout, Sunil>claims data and the market access data to
show what is the how what is the NPI</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/377-0
00:44:19.949 --> 00:44:20.069
<v Kumawat, Jaya>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/378-2
00:44:24.268 --> 00:44:28.825
<v Rout, Sunil>facing the highest prior authorization
and step therapy a burden in for that</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/378-3
00:44:28.825 --> 00:44:29.949
<v Rout, Sunil>particular product.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/379-0
00:44:31.429 --> 00:44:35.709
<v Rout, Sunil>Then coming to the next one,
it will tell you the payer, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/381-0
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:36.864
<v Miller, Jeremy>Sorry, sorry. Can you go back?
Can you go back a little bit?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/380-0
00:44:36.749 --> 00:44:37.829
<v Rout, Sunil>Sure, sure.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/381-1
00:44:36.864 --> 00:44:40.803
<v Miller, Jeremy>I have a question here. So,
so from everything that I've heard,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/381-2
00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:43.880
<v Miller, Jeremy>so that all makes perfect sense.
I understand it.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/381-3
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.620
<v Miller, Jeremy>For everything that I've heard, the,
you know, the PA burden quantification,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/381-4
00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.789
<v Miller, Jeremy>the rejection rate.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/383-0
00:44:50.149 --> 00:44:54.674
<v Miller, Jeremy>Possibly even the abandonment rate is all
traditional analytics.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/383-1
00:44:54.674 --> 00:44:59.269
<v Miller, Jeremy>The part that you're looking for us to
help you solve is the why.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/384-0
00:45:00.509 --> 00:45:01.989
<v Miller, Jeremy>Does that sound correct?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/386-0
00:45:01.669 --> 00:45:04.025
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes.
And also we will get some of the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/386-1
00:45:04.025 --> 00:45:08.365
<v Rout, Sunil>information from the clinical notes,
right, which is validate, right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/386-2
00:45:08.365 --> 00:45:13.139
<v Rout, Sunil>If his patient is basically abandoned
because of the prior authorizations or</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/389-0
00:45:11.749 --> 00:45:15.525
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, that that's the why, right.
So you can observe through claims,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/386-3
00:45:13.139 --> 00:45:14.069
<v Rout, Sunil>maybe yes, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/385-0
00:45:14.509 --> 00:45:14.909
<v Kumawat, Jaya>The what?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/389-1
00:45:15.525 --> 00:45:18.426
<v Miller, Jeremy>for example,
that a patient is on therapy A and then</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/389-2
00:45:18.426 --> 00:45:21.163
<v Miller, Jeremy>they switch to therapy B,
but you don't know why.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/387-0
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.389
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/389-3
00:45:21.163 --> 00:45:24.392
<v Miller, Jeremy>So the question is,
did the patient switch because of some</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/388-0
00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:22.109
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/389-4
00:45:24.392 --> 00:45:28.332
<v Miller, Jeremy>authorization burden either from the
perspective of the provider or the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/391-0
00:45:27.029 --> 00:45:31.549
<v Rout, Sunil>Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.
Absolutely. Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/389-5
00:45:28.332 --> 00:45:28.989
<v Miller, Jeremy>patient, OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/390-0
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:30.509
<v Miller, Jeremy>I got it. OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/397-0
00:45:30.709 --> 00:45:36.370
<v Kumawat, Jaya>All the patients switched because of some
adverse events because the safety profile</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/393-0
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:35.389
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes, correct, correct.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/397-1
00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:39.740
<v Kumawat, Jaya>of the drug was not good and across 100
patients,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/392-0
00:45:36.509 --> 00:45:36.949
<v Rout, Sunil>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/394-0

<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/397-2
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:44.997
<v Kumawat, Jaya>the same safety event is seen across it
is 70 patients. For example, Ozempic,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/397-3
00:45:44.997 --> 00:45:50.389
<v Kumawat, Jaya>out of the 100 patients who were injected
with Ozempic, 70 had a cardiac event.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/396-0
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.989

00:45:50.469 --> 00:45:54.968
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I'm I'm just throwing numbers on the fly,
but that that we only can get from</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/398-0
00:45:51.029 --> 00:45:53.229

00:45:54.968 --> 00:45:56.429
<v Kumawat, Jaya>clinical units generally.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/404-0
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:59.829
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes, the lack of efficacy, adverse effect.
Yes, of course.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/402-0
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.789
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, so.</v>

00:45:59.549 --> 00:46:02.339
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, so so Jeremy,
I think it can reuse quite a bit of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/403-0
00:45:59.949 --> 00:46:00.109

00:46:02.339 --> 00:46:05.377
<v Malik, Hassan>infrastructure we are building for the
nodes project, right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/406-0
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:06.269

<v Malik, Hassan>So the with the with the summary in the
generic data feed.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/407-0
00:46:05.909 --> 00:46:06.829

00:46:08.316 --> 00:46:11.056
<v Malik, Hassan>So we would just want to make sure that
the, you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/409-4
00:46:11.056 --> 00:46:14.643
<v Malik, Hassan>generic data feed have these events that
we are looking for here or the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/409-5
00:46:14.643 --> 00:46:15.589

00:46:16.469 --> 00:46:19.029
<v Malik, Hassan>And and yeah,
then if it's a patient is not summarized,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/410-1
00:46:19.029 --> 00:46:21.909
<v Malik, Hassan>it can be done even on the fly or
something along those lines.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/413-0
00:46:23.229 --> 00:46:26.820
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, I mean,
Notes Chat is a good prototype of this,</v>

00:46:37.617 --> 00:46:41.227
<v Kumawat, Jaya>we must be having a road map of the
therapeutic area,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/419-2
00:46:41.227 --> 00:46:46.307
<v Kumawat, Jaya>the diseases of the products that we are
processing the clinical notes for.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/419-3
00:46:46.307 --> 00:46:51.254
<v Kumawat, Jaya>I'm asking this so that we create a
parallel and aligned road map for our</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/417-0
00:46:46.629 --> 00:46:47.629

<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah. So that's a good point.
I mean we it's really driven by no chat</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/423-1
00:46:57.135 --> 00:47:00.298

<v Malik, Hassan>everything. That's the plan.
But but look we we can use multiple</v>

00:47:04.036 --> 00:47:07.429
<v Malik, Hassan>business justifications, right.
So if you have a road map.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/425-0
00:47:08.229 --> 00:47:10.673

00:47:14.033 --> 00:47:16.913
<v Malik, Hassan>we can go back and summarize those
because now we have a business</v>

00:47:16.913 --> 00:47:20.404
<v Malik, Hassan>justification as long as you know you
have potential revenue associated with it</v>

00:49:34.749 --> 00:49:40.636
<v Rout, Sunil>Growth is basically happening from the
time of launch to till date and then I</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/448-1
00:49:40.636 --> 00:49:44.938

<v Rout, Sunil>basically their adoption rate, right.
So we can basically see early adopter.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/447-0

00:49:54.593 --> 00:49:59.292
<v Rout, Sunil>Then we want to see who what is the time
to 1st prescriptions from the 30 days of</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/449-2
00:49:59.292 --> 00:50:01.757
<v Rout, Sunil>launch,
how many prescribers are basically</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/449-3
00:50:01.757 --> 00:50:05.425
<v Rout, Sunil>prescribing that particular brand from 30
to 60 days of launch,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/449-4

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/450-0
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:15.678
<v Rout, Sunil>Rate from my launch till date or maybe I
can have a time period I can define that</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/450-1
00:50:15.678 --> 00:50:20.175
<v Rout, Sunil>right and then coming to the favorable
access where I just want to know the NPI</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/450-2
00:50:20.175 --> 00:50:24.615
<v Rout, Sunil>having though who are prescribing those
brands or the brand basically how many</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/450-3

<v Rout, Sunil>Having excellent favorable excellent
access or having good or limited they're</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/451-1
00:50:31.357 --> 00:50:35.054
<v Rout, Sunil>prescribing it but it is getting rejected
or PA or SD right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/451-2
00:50:35.054 --> 00:50:40.146
<v Rout, Sunil>So we have to understand the prescribers
are basically prescribing the brand right.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/451-3
00:50:40.146 --> 00:50:44.692
<v Rout, Sunil>But if there any market access barrier
attached to those brands or for the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/451-4
00:50:44.692 --> 00:50:46.389

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/456-3
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.429
<v Kumawat, Jaya>to the HCP's.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/457-0
00:51:56.989 --> 00:51:57.629
<v Rout, Sunil>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/458-0
00:52:15.709 --> 00:52:15.949
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/465-0
00:52:15.989 --> 00:52:19.087
<v Malik, Hassan>So, so this, this, this,
this would be very broad, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/459-0
00:52:16.949 --> 00:52:17.469
Yeah.

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/465-1
00:52:19.087 --> 00:52:22.291
<v Malik, Hassan>So maybe add some filters here because
whoever is doing it,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/460-0
00:52:21.189 --> 00:52:22.989
<v Rout, Sunil>Mm-hmm. OK, yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/465-2
00:52:22.291 --> 00:52:24.694
<v Malik, Hassan>we're generally going to look for,
you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/461-0
00:52:24.389 --> 00:52:26.749
<v Rout, Sunil>That reason, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/465-3
00:52:24.694 --> 00:52:29.020
<v Malik, Hassan>who should I target or who are the top in
New York City or New York or whatever.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/462-0
00:52:28.189 --> 00:52:29.589
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes, yes, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/465-4
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:32.278
<v Malik, Hassan>So maybe somewhat of a flexible way of of
filtering it down.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/465-5
00:52:32.278 --> 00:52:35.589
<v Malik, Hassan>The default view can be exactly this,
but then you filter by.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/467-0
00:52:35.909 --> 00:52:40.359
<v Malik, Hassan>State by city, zip code, you know,
whatever they want to. OK, so that's one,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/464-0
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:39.229
<v Rout, Sunil>Correct, correct, correct, correct.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/467-1
00:52:40.359 --> 00:52:44.809
<v Malik, Hassan>right? So that's that's one feedback.
The second feedback is that there were</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/467-2
00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:48.161
<v Malik, Hassan>there can be and maybe that's a separate
use case, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/467-3
00:52:48.161 --> 00:52:51.109
<v Malik, Hassan>But what we were discussing at that time
was that.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/469-0
00:52:51.269 --> 00:52:55.328
<v Malik, Hassan>Let's say you have a limited sales
resources that are going to target</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/466-0
00:52:53.669 --> 00:52:54.349
<v Rout, Sunil>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/469-1
00:52:55.328 --> 00:52:59.792
<v Malik, Hassan>certain physicians to hit, you know,
certain goals in a certain time period.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/469-2
00:52:59.792 --> 00:53:02.575
<v Malik, Hassan>Let's say for Q3, I want to increase,
you know,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/469-3
00:53:02.575 --> 00:53:06.228
<v Malik, Hassan>the market penetration of this drug by
this much in this area,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/469-4
00:53:06.228 --> 00:53:09.069
<v Malik, Hassan>but but that's always, you know, by area,
right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/473-0
00:53:09.469 --> 00:53:14.083
<v Malik, Hassan>So who are the top 2030 fifty 100 you
know whatever doctors that I should</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/468-0
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.789
<v Rout, Sunil>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/473-1
00:53:14.083 --> 00:53:19.133
<v Malik, Hassan>target and and then what evidence can I
arm you know these sales reps with right</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/470-0
00:53:15.149 --> 00:53:15.629
<v Rout, Sunil>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/473-2
00:53:19.133 --> 00:53:24.059
<v Malik, Hassan>whoever is going to target need to have
you know have to have some information</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/471-0
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:20.029
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/472-0
00:53:23.989 --> 00:53:24.709
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Mhm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/473-3
00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:29.109
<v Malik, Hassan>like so and and the idea at that time was
that we can provide for example their.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/474-0
00:53:29.429 --> 00:53:33.443
<v Malik, Hassan>Peer set with that are prescribing higher
than them,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/474-1
00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:36.927
<v Malik, Hassan>so have very similar patient
characteristics,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/474-2
00:53:36.927 --> 00:53:41.775
<v Malik, Hassan>but the peer set is writing that drug to
40% of their patients,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/474-3
00:53:41.775 --> 00:53:47.607
<v Malik, Hassan>whereas this specific prescriber that
they're going to is writing to 20% and</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/474-4
00:53:47.607 --> 00:53:49.349
<v Malik, Hassan>then you can also have.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/478-0
00:53:49.429 --> 00:53:54.272
<v Malik, Hassan>More supporting data from RWD which
basically says here is the so so because</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/478-1
00:53:54.272 --> 00:53:58.801
<v Malik, Hassan>they're prescribing this here, here,
here is the positive impact on the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/478-2
00:53:58.801 --> 00:54:02.826
<v Malik, Hassan>patient population right.
So so stuff like that can be you know</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/476-0
00:53:59.189 --> 00:54:01.789
<v Rout, Sunil>Absolutely, absolutely, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/477-0
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:03.949
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah, sure.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/478-3
00:54:02.826 --> 00:54:05.908
<v Malik, Hassan>very good,
you know make make this substantially</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/479-0
00:54:03.269 --> 00:54:07.150
<v Rout, Sunil>Yep, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
Also we are we can customize.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/478-4
00:54:05.908 --> 00:54:06.789
<v Malik, Hassan>more valuable.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/479-1
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:12.345
<v Rout, Sunil>Basically we can give a zip to zip to
territory of configure file here because</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/479-2
00:54:12.345 --> 00:54:17.344
<v Rout, Sunil>all pharma company having their different
zip and territory mapping, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/479-3
00:54:17.344 --> 00:54:21.422
<v Rout, Sunil>So if I basically upload my zip and
territory alignment here,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/479-4
00:54:21.422 --> 00:54:22.869
<v Rout, Sunil>I can get the list of.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/480-0
00:54:23.149 --> 00:54:27.571
<v Rout, Sunil>Physicians in my territory or maybe a
territory assigned to my to me, right?</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/480-1
00:54:27.571 --> 00:54:32.050
<v Rout, Sunil>So basically we can have a configurable
file here basically to upload the GPT</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/480-2
00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:36.242
<v Rout, Sunil>territory mapping and they can be
targeted based on the reasons or maybe</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/480-3
00:54:36.242 --> 00:54:38.309
<v Rout, Sunil>the sales Rep who want to basically.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/481-0
00:54:38.469 --> 00:54:40.029
<v Rout, Sunil>Assign with that particular physician.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/482-0
00:54:40.589 --> 00:54:41.989
<v Malik, Hassan>Sounds good. Yep. OK.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/488-0
00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:45.463
<v Kumawat, Jaya>So Sunil,
can we add both of these suggestions from</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/483-0
00:54:42.389 --> 00:54:42.589
<v Rout, Sunil>Yep.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/488-1
00:54:45.463 --> 00:54:50.218
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Hassan onto the prototype? Yeah,
both the filters that Hassan mentioned</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/484-0
00:54:45.989 --> 00:54:50.749
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes, yes, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, I can.
I can do that. Yes. Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/488-2
00:54:50.218 --> 00:54:55.634
<v Kumawat, Jaya>and the additional data that we want to
provide to the sales Rep fully equip them</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/488-3
00:54:55.634 --> 00:54:57.549
<v Kumawat, Jaya>to go and target the doctors.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/485-0
00:54:56.269 --> 00:54:56.549
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/486-0
00:54:57.949 --> 00:54:58.029
<v Malik, Hassan>The.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/487-0
00:54:58.389 --> 00:54:59.429
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes, for sure.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/493-0
00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:01.705
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah.
And that can that can also change the</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/493-1
00:55:01.705 --> 00:55:04.239
<v Malik, Hassan>ranking per se, right.
Because here what so, so,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/489-0
00:55:03.149 --> 00:55:05.189
<v Rout, Sunil>Yes, yes, yes.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/493-2
00:55:04.239 --> 00:55:08.481
<v Malik, Hassan>so the difference is you know whether we
are just presenting the current facts or</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/493-3
00:55:08.481 --> 00:55:12.464
<v Malik, Hassan>we are predicting something that can
change facts for the future, right. So,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/490-0
00:55:10.949 --> 00:55:11.109
<v Rout, Sunil>Mm.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/493-4
00:55:12.464 --> 00:55:16.602
<v Malik, Hassan>so that the letter becomes much more
useful because the the, the current stuff,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/491-0
00:55:13.869 --> 00:55:14.149
<v Kumawat, Jaya>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/492-0
00:55:13.949 --> 00:55:14.189
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/493-5
00:55:16.602 --> 00:55:18.309
<v Malik, Hassan>I mean you know we are of course.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/495-0
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:22.018
<v Malik, Hassan>We have a bunch of different data sources
that are coming together.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/495-1
00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:25.894
<v Malik, Hassan>It's still useful for someone to see,
but but again, it goes back to, well,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/495-2
00:55:25.894 --> 00:55:30.077
<v Malik, Hassan>here are the ones that are already doing
something that they want versus the ones</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/495-3
00:55:30.077 --> 00:55:33.189
<v Malik, Hassan>that that we have a bigger opportunity to
make a difference.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/494-0
00:55:33.429 --> 00:55:34.829
<v Rout, Sunil>Yeah.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/497-0
00:55:33.749 --> 00:55:38.498
<v Rout, Sunil>Right, right. OK. Yeah, we can basically,
if you want to think through,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/497-1
00:55:38.498 --> 00:55:42.719
<v Rout, Sunil>maybe we can add AIML to see what is
their prescribing pattern,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/497-2
00:55:42.719 --> 00:55:48.127
<v Rout, Sunil>who are having the high potentials and
add some of these peer comparisons, right,</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/496-0
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.309
<v Malik, Hassan>1.</v>

b414eb9b-11ab-48bd-946b-27e934f62345/497-3
00:55:48.127 --> 00:55:48.589
