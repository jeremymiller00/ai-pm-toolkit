00:00:22.553 --> 00:00:24.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>Friday. Pretty good.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/13-0
00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah, Friday.
My wife is with her girlfriend in the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/13-1
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.273
<v Bayed, Sofian>living room. Like, who's Jeremy?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/17-0
00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:37.027
<v Miller, Jeremy>Oh, sorry. Yeah, it's late for you. So.
So I was a little confused because so</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/17-1
00:00:37.027 --> 00:00:42.145
<v Miller, Jeremy>next week you go off summertime,
but we're still on daylight savings time</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/14-0
00:00:41.313 --> 00:00:44.273
<v Bayed, Sofian>Oh, so it's not even a word yet.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/17-2
00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:46.087
<v Miller, Jeremy>for one week. Yeah,
it's it happens every year. So yeah,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/17-3
00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:51.273
<v Miller, Jeremy>there's a we go a week early and we go
off a week late. So I thought that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/15-0
00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:47.953
<v Bayed, Sofian>It.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/18-0
00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Miller, Jeremy>That I had it in my head that this was
gonna oh, it's only 7 hours to the UK,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/18-1
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.713
<v Miller, Jeremy>but.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/20-0
00:00:55.673 --> 00:01:01.073
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah, yeah, it's OK. Sorry.

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/19-0
00:00:56.913 --> 00:00:58.233

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:01.913
<v Miller, Jeremy>10.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/22-0
00:01:03.073 --> 00:01:04.313
<v Bayed, Sofian>OK, makes sense.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/23-0
00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:05.153

00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:17.193
<v Miller, Jeremy>I don't think we hear you. There we go.
Now I hear you. Yeah. Yeah. Happy Friday.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/25-0
00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:15.313
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Talking on mute. Sorry. How are you doing?
It's Friday afternoon.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/27-0
00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:17.793
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>you do.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/28-0
00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:21.513
<v Miller, Jeremy>How have you been?
Haven't talked in a while.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/29-0
00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:24.993
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I know, right? Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.
How are you?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/30-0
00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:27.113
<v Miller, Jeremy>Pretty good. Pretty good. Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/31-0
00:01:28.353 --> 00:01:32.348
<v Miller, Jeremy>Gonna give Surreal a moment.
So Surreal is our new principal data</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/31-1
00:01:32.348 --> 00:01:32.953
<v Miller, Jeremy>scientist.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/33-0
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:40.174
<v Miller, Jeremy>You may remember a fellow called Suresh.
He left us a while back and Surreal is</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/33-1
00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:44.379
<v Miller, Jeremy>now filling that role,
so we're hoping he can help us out with</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/33-2
00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:44.913
<v Miller, Jeremy>his POC.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/34-0
00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:47.193
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Alright, cool. Sounds good.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/35-0
00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:56.908
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I'm about to start bugging you again,
Sophia, next week, so sorry.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/35-1
00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.191
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Now that we're close to go live for
fusion,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/35-2
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:02.873
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I'm going to be hounding you back on your
radar for enhancement stuff.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/38-0
00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:05.787
<v Bayed, Sofian>Sure, sure, no problem. Yeah,
I think I saw a couple of tickets.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/36-0
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:04.033
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Thanks.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/38-1
00:02:05.787 --> 00:02:10.836
<v Bayed, Sofian>I'm not sure this is all relevant to data
science.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/37-0
00:02:07.553 --> 00:02:07.873
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/38-2
00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:14.993
<v Bayed, Sofian>I saw some a ticket about site resolution.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/39-0
00:02:15.513 --> 00:02:18.833
<v Bayed, Sofian>Some of the sites were not properly
resolved, right?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/41-0
00:02:19.953 --> 00:02:23.071
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah, but honestly,
I think that's probably gonna sort itself</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/41-1
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:25.786
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>out in the next month when we have the
feedback loop.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/41-2
00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:29.155
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I'm not too concerned about that.
I'm talking more like new stuff,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/40-0
00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:26.593
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/43-0
00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:33.422
<v Bayed, Sofian>OK. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, new stuff. Yeah,
sure. The time frames and um,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/41-3
00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:30.713
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>which is cool and exciting, so.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/42-0
00:02:31.873 --> 00:02:32.193
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Cool.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/43-1
00:02:33.422 --> 00:02:37.073
<v Bayed, Sofian>I guess the enhancements we want to
implement, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/45-0
00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:40.544
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Structured results. Yeah,
there's a couple of things I think that,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/46-0
00:02:39.273 --> 00:02:41.993
<v Bayed, Sofian>Nice. Yeah, that sounds interesting.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/45-1
00:02:40.544 --> 00:02:40.833
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/47-0
00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:43.033
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>The.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/50-0
00:02:45.113 --> 00:02:47.728
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Cool. Glad. Me too. I think so too.
I also,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/48-0
00:02:47.113 --> 00:02:47.473
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/50-1
00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:51.175
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I guess while we're waiting that the
protocols we parsed.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/50-2
00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:54.146
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So I know we just parsed and stored them
for now,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/50-3
00:02:54.146 --> 00:02:59.138
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but there's getting a lot of interest on
pulling out pieces of it in specific ways.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/50-4
00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:01.753
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So that was the other thing I was going
to.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/52-0
00:03:01.753 --> 00:03:05.113
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Could try to get on your radar. Cool.
Thank you.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/49-0
00:03:02.513 --> 00:03:02.633
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/51-0
00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:04.513
<v Bayed, Sofian>Sure.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/54-0
00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:20.073
<v Miller, Jeremy>Meeting Surreal and see if he's able to
join. No, we'll just get started.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/53-0
00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:18.513
<v Bayed, Sofian>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/55-0
00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:35.515
<v Miller, Jeremy>So to give you a little context, G,
we we know that this concept of health</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/55-1
00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:39.848
<v Miller, Jeremy>network detection,
it might not be phrasing it the right way,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/55-2
00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:45.299
<v Miller, Jeremy>but has come up as something that we
would be interested in looking at and we</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/55-3
00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.793
<v Miller, Jeremy>have one person on our team who's a a
contractor.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/58-0
00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:54.226
<v Miller, Jeremy>Who does the UI work for our knowledge
graph UI and as well as some other sort</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/58-1
00:03:54.226 --> 00:03:57.393
<v Miller, Jeremy>of back end work.
And he's finished the work he's working</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/56-0
00:03:55.913 --> 00:03:56.273
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/58-2
00:03:57.393 --> 00:04:01.324
<v Miller, Jeremy>on and we have him until the end of the
year. So the thought was, well,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/58-3
00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:05.146
<v Miller, Jeremy>let's see if we we know we have this
concept we want to do a PAC for.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/58-4
00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:09.022
<v Miller, Jeremy>Let's see if we can get it in,
but we still have this guy who can help</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/58-5
00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:09.513
<v Miller, Jeremy>us a bit.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/57-0
00:04:10.113 --> 00:04:11.713
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK, cool. Awesome.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/59-0
00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:17.353
<v Miller, Jeremy>And um,
why don't you go ahead and just start?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/60-0
00:04:18.513 --> 00:04:21.645
<v Miller, Jeremy>Tell us what the problem was,
what the use case is,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/60-1
00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:23.753
<v Miller, Jeremy>and what we're trying to solve for.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/61-0
00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:27.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>G.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/63-0
00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:33.057
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Oh, OK, sure. Sorry. I can tell you.
I can tell you what mine is. Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/62-0
00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:32.513
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yes, tell us your use case.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/63-1
00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:36.963
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>All right,
so there's a bunch of stuff baked into</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/63-2
00:04:36.963 --> 00:04:37.353
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>this.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/64-0
00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:43.331
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Sorry,
I'm trying to think of where to start.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/64-1
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:47.189
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Basically,
we're getting different flavors of</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/64-2
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:54.233
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>requests of relationships between various
types of things that are called networks.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/65-0
00:04:54.953 --> 00:04:58.674
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Just a little bit of background in that
the the definition of this,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/65-1
00:04:58.674 --> 00:05:02.833
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>none of these are very well defined,
which is part of the work I'm starting</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/65-2
00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:06.664
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>next week is to get a better handle on
what we as Norstella think our</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/65-3
00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:09.892
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>definitions are,
but the various flavors of things that we</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/65-4
00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:10.713
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>hear about are.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/66-0
00:05:10.793 --> 00:05:14.757
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Site networks,
which seems to range from sites that work</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/66-1
00:05:14.757 --> 00:05:20.251
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>together to sites that share financial
ties to sites that share administrative</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/66-2
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:24.075
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>ties. Health networks,
which seems to run the gamut of</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/66-3
00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>definitions of insurance companies,
insurance networks,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/66-4
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.473
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>loose disease networks of unrelated.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/67-0
00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:33.165
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Sites and hospitals, hospital networks,
etc.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/67-1
00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:36.515
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>We also have heard of interest about
referral networks,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/67-2
00:05:36.515 --> 00:05:40.463
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>which could be sites or people,
and they could be related from an</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/67-3
00:05:40.463 --> 00:05:44.471
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>organization level or not.
And then there was another one in there</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/67-4
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:48.778
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>too. So anyway, Long story short,
there's like various levels of things</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/67-5
00:05:48.778 --> 00:05:50.393
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>where we need to decide on.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/68-0
00:05:50.473 --> 00:05:55.008
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Definitions and taxonomy. But past that,
once we have those things in place,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/68-1
00:05:55.008 --> 00:05:59.013
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>which we are starting on,
I think we have really good structure and</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/68-2
00:05:59.013 --> 00:06:02.429
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>fusion to do some really cool,
interesting stuff with it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/68-3
00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:07.082
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>But we're going to need to somehow map
and apply all of this structure once we</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/68-4
00:06:07.082 --> 00:06:07.553
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>have it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/69-0
00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:12.319
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And that's where I'm a little stuck is
that I can see in my head that there will</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/69-1
00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.975
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>be lots of relationships.
There will be relationships between the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/69-2
00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:19.021
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>person master and the org master and the
trial master.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/69-3
00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:22.122
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And like I can see that the need for the
relationships,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/69-4
00:06:22.122 --> 00:06:25.833
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>we have the structure and the taxonomy in
place once we have that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/70-0
00:06:25.993 --> 00:06:30.558
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>How do we then apply it and map it?
And I know there's some pieces of</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/70-1
00:06:30.558 --> 00:06:35.906
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>referral information in the RWD set also,
like you can see what doctor referred a</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/70-2
00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>patient to another doctor,
but that's kind of even a separate thing</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/70-3
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.753
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>in that they might not necessarily even
be in the same network or know each other.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/71-0
00:06:45.753 --> 00:06:50.432
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I guess there's a lot of pieces floating
around that are very vague right now.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/71-1
00:06:50.432 --> 00:06:54.874
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I know that there's structure needed on
the definition side and what we as</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/71-2
00:06:54.874 --> 00:06:58.013
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Norstella think it should be.
But once we have that,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/71-3
00:06:58.013 --> 00:07:02.633
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>how do I then go and apply that to the
existing data set in a way that's not?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/72-0
00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:06.352
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Someone manually doing it, I guess.
So there's a couple things baked in there,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/72-1
00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:08.793
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but I guess that's kind of like the
overall problem.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/73-0
00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:14.913
<v Miller, Jeremy>Want to give that a go, Sofia,
or do you want me to try?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/74-0
00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:18.614
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah,
I mean obviously there is the technical</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/74-1
00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:25.277
<v Bayed, Sofian>aspects of building relationships and
graphs to to kind of unveil, you know,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/74-2
00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:30.210
<v Bayed, Sofian>connections between between different
nodes or entities,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/74-3
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.633
<v Bayed, Sofian>but I am more interested in.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/75-0
00:07:32.993 --> 00:07:38.525
<v Bayed, Sofian>What the product looks like,
what kind of what kind of insights do we</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/75-1
00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:42.239
<v Bayed, Sofian>want to provide? Is this, you know,
a chatbot?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/75-2
00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Bayed, Sofian>Is this some kind of dashboard where we
could see connections between different</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/75-3
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.353
<v Bayed, Sofian>sites?
It's more about the delivery and having.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/76-0
00:07:52.553 --> 00:07:57.630
<v Bayed, Sofian>Top down approach and then we can think
about the technical aspects, but um,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/76-1
00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.673
<v Bayed, Sofian>I I don't know if you have any.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/78-0
00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Oh, from my perspective,
obviously I want the data.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/78-1
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.980
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I want all the data structured and and
relationships between it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/77-0
00:08:08.273 --> 00:08:08.673
<v Bayed, Sofian>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/78-2
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.356
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And so that's I guess kind of my end
product,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/78-3
00:08:12.356 --> 00:08:17.273
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but from an actual product what we're
going to sell type of place.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/79-0
00:08:17.633 --> 00:08:20.459
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>It seems to be coming up in various Rd.
maps,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/79-1
00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:22.793
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>so I think I heard there's a piece in.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/82-0
00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:30.269
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>ISS where they want to have some sort of
a metric that they're somehow surfacing</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/82-1
00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:35.102
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>networks together.
There's a referral network piece that's</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/82-2
00:08:35.102 --> 00:08:40.673
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>coming up with what product PSD or ISS,
one of the smart solutions.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/81-0
00:08:35.713 --> 00:08:35.953
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/83-0
00:08:41.233 --> 00:08:45.015
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So there's kind of I'm hearing about it
in multiple other places,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/83-1
00:08:45.015 --> 00:08:49.369
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but I've also been on very quite a few
client calls recently where everyone</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/83-2
00:08:49.369 --> 00:08:52.635
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>agrees that there's no standard
definition in out there.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/83-3
00:08:52.635 --> 00:08:56.473
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Everyone agrees that everyone's using the
terminology too loosely.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/85-0
00:08:56.753 --> 00:08:59.582
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And people are asking us,
clients are asking us,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/85-1
00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:03.451
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>what is your version of the taxonomy and
can we use it and buy it?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/85-2
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:07.839
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So I think there's quite a few ways that
we could use this once we have it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/84-0
00:09:06.753 --> 00:09:06.993
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/85-3
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:11.072
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And that's kind of,
I guess from my my perspective too,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/85-4
00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:15.634
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I want to make sure I future-proof this
as much as possible because I think it</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/85-5
00:09:15.634 --> 00:09:16.153
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>would be.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/87-0
00:09:16.273 --> 00:09:18.517
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Products also, Sophie.
So I I guess I'm a little,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/87-1
00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:21.882
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I don't want to get too tied down into
what it looks like on the other end</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/87-2
00:09:21.882 --> 00:09:25.113
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>because I think once we have it,
it could end up in quite a few places.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/86-0
00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:25.873
<v Bayed, Sofian>Make sense? Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/88-0
00:09:25.353 --> 00:09:29.562
<v Miller, Jeremy>And I think my I would start at a higher
level of I'm just going to say</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/88-1
00:09:29.562 --> 00:09:32.778
<v Miller, Jeremy>abstraction,
which is what are the I understand all of</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/88-2
00:09:32.778 --> 00:09:37.455
<v Miller, Jeremy>these things at a conceptual level and
yeah, they need to be defined of course,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/88-3
00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:41.313
<v Miller, Jeremy>blah blah, and you're very data savvy,
so you've got all of that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/89-0
00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:44.876
<v Miller, Jeremy>But what are the value propositions?
Like why do clients want to know these</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/89-1
00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.593
<v Miller, Jeremy>things and what are they going to do with
this information?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/90-0
00:09:49.233 --> 00:09:54.031
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So the last piece I talked about is they
want to take their internal data and</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/90-1
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:58.214
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>apply our structure to it.
So they want to structure their internal</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/90-2
00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:01.844
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>databases with network information and
who works together.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/90-3
00:10:01.844 --> 00:10:04.673
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I've heard other cases of clients wanting
to.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/91-0
00:10:04.713 --> 00:10:10.614
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Identify networks so that they can use
sites that are in the same network as an</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/91-1
00:10:10.614 --> 00:10:16.735
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>existing site they've already used before.
I think for ISS they want to be able to</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/91-2
00:10:16.735 --> 00:10:19.833
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>provide metrics around investigators that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/92-0
00:10:20.113 --> 00:10:23.714
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Are in the same network or in the same
referral network, site work,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/92-1
00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:26.944
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>network or referral network.
So I guess there's quite a few,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/92-2
00:10:26.944 --> 00:10:29.433
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>there's quite a few that I've heard of so
far.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/94-0
00:10:28.793 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, there's a few things there. Yeah.
So metrics and analytics is a pile of use</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/94-1
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.501
<v Miller, Jeremy>cases.
I can that that makes perfect sense.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/93-0
00:10:35.953 --> 00:10:36.193
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/94-2
00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:40.784
<v Miller, Jeremy>I'm sure that will come up many times
IDing sites for trials. I mean,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/94-3
00:10:40.784 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Miller, Jeremy>that's a different way of,
I think what we're talking about is a</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/94-4
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.553
<v Miller, Jeremy>different way of solving a problem that
we already have some.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/95-0
00:10:48.553 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Miller, Jeremy>Sort of solution for right?
Like isn't there a way in trial trove or</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/95-1
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.242
<v Miller, Jeremy>site trove to go in and and part of the
purpose of that product right is like I</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/95-2
00:10:58.242 --> 00:11:00.713
<v Miller, Jeremy>have a trial I'm looking for sites so.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/96-0
00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:03.976
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>You can see the sites that are associated
with a given trial.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/96-1
00:11:03.976 --> 00:11:07.833
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>You can't see beyond that two sites that
work together regularly.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/97-0
00:11:09.073 --> 00:11:09.553
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/99-0
00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:13.209
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And I think that is one of the desires is
to once,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/99-1
00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:16.795
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>especially with now that there are
financial and capability of relationships</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/99-2
00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:20.056
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>between a lot of these site networks is
to find like, OK, I know I'm,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/99-3
00:11:20.056 --> 00:11:23.270
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I know I've been successful with this
site that has this capability.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/99-4
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.297
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I would like to expand that and find the
other sites that, yeah,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/98-0
00:11:25.313 --> 00:11:25.433
<v Miller, Jeremy>Right.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/99-5
00:11:26.297 --> 00:11:28.393
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>so there's the kind of that piece of it
too.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/100-0
00:11:26.393 --> 00:11:30.593
<v Miller, Jeremy>Show me the friends of my friends. Yeah,
yeah, get that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/102-0
00:11:28.913 --> 00:11:31.570
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah,
I think there's also desire to use some</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/102-1
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.556
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>of the proprietary data in a way also.
So once we have the networks,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/102-2
00:11:35.556 --> 00:11:40.062
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>you could then do some metrics around.
This network has a better shorter site</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/102-3
00:11:40.062 --> 00:11:44.278
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>activation time frame than this network
because you could link the site.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/102-4
00:11:44.278 --> 00:11:47.513
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>We have it at site level,
but not any higher than that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/103-0
00:11:48.113 --> 00:11:54.137
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So everything would can be rolled up at
that point into a higher network score,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/101-0
00:11:48.553 --> 00:11:48.913
<v Miller, Jeremy>Got it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/103-1
00:11:54.137 --> 00:11:54.513
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/106-0
00:11:54.473 --> 00:11:57.464
<v Miller, Jeremy>So some sort, yeah,
that so that makes sense.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/106-1
00:11:57.464 --> 00:12:02.731
<v Miller, Jeremy>And then the first thing that you said
was users want to take our our take their</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/106-2
00:12:02.731 --> 00:12:05.657
<v Miller, Jeremy>internal data and apply our structure to
it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/105-0
00:12:05.593 --> 00:12:05.953
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yes.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/106-3
00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:10.273
<v Miller, Jeremy>And to me I would split that into sort of
two basic sets of use cases.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/107-0
00:12:10.793 --> 00:12:16.033
<v Miller, Jeremy>One of them is is joining data where they
want to have a way to take their</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/107-1
00:12:16.033 --> 00:12:21.762
<v Miller, Jeremy>proprietary data that only they have and
join it to our data in their environment</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/107-2
00:12:21.762 --> 00:12:25.953
<v Miller, Jeremy>or a neutral environment or a safe
environment to increase.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/108-0
00:12:26.073 --> 00:12:29.240
<v Miller, Jeremy>Their capabilities,
another which another one would be I</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/108-1
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.461
<v Miller, Jeremy>think more literally what you said,
which was they just want to know how to</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/108-2
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:37.794
<v Miller, Jeremy>organize their data so that they can.
They want a standardized structure that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/108-3
00:12:37.794 --> 00:12:41.516
<v Miller, Jeremy>will make sense in the world,
that will be understandable to other</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/108-4
00:12:41.516 --> 00:12:44.793
<v Miller, Jeremy>folks that will allow them to organize
their data and get.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/109-0
00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:46.913
<v Miller, Jeremy>Information and value out of it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/110-0
00:12:48.513 --> 00:12:52.593
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Um, yes, I think. I think more the latter.
I think that they.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/111-0
00:12:52.593 --> 00:12:52.713
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/112-0
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:57.883
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Probably can do more of the former
without this because they could still,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/112-1
00:12:57.883 --> 00:13:02.804
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I think join based on what we because
they don't have the network information.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/112-2
00:13:02.804 --> 00:13:07.600
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>It's not like they have it in there you
they would use it to bridge to ours.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/112-3
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.593
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Nobody has it. It's kind of the.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/113-0
00:13:09.713 --> 00:13:13.867
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Big gap in the and and everybody starts
talking about it and throwing around the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/113-1
00:13:13.867 --> 00:13:17.405
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>terms very loosely and it's a very hot
but like hot words right now,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/113-2
00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:19.353
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but nobody really knows what it means.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/114-0
00:13:19.713 --> 00:13:24.436
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK, so I want to drill down on that.
You said nobody has the network</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/114-1
00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:27.517
<v Miller, Jeremy>information.
So tell us exactly what is this</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/114-2
00:13:27.517 --> 00:13:29.433
<v Miller, Jeremy>information that nobody has?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/115-0
00:13:29.033 --> 00:13:34.273
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>A structured definition and taxonomy of
what they consider a network.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/116-0
00:13:34.873 --> 00:13:34.993
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/117-0
00:13:37.073 --> 00:13:37.153
<v Miller, Jeremy>So.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/118-0
00:13:38.953 --> 00:13:43.193
<v Miller, Jeremy>So that's I wouldn't call that
information, I would call that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/119-0
00:13:44.233 --> 00:13:48.259
<v Miller, Jeremy>Well, let's.
I don't know the right way to say this,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/119-1
00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:51.753
<v Miller, Jeremy>but it did a definition, a taxonomy.
So it's.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/120-0
00:13:50.953 --> 00:13:55.473
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>A definition and a and a and categories.
So yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/121-0
00:13:53.993 --> 00:13:57.350
<v Miller, Jeremy>Right,
which would then be populated with data</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/121-1
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:58.993
<v Miller, Jeremy>to produce information.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/123-0
00:14:01.353 --> 00:14:04.715
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I would, I would tag.
I would use it to add attributes to</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/122-0
00:14:01.593 --> 00:14:03.433
<v Miller, Jeremy>If I understand correctly the.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/123-1
00:14:04.715 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>existing site profiles and investigator
profiles and things like that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/123-2
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.307
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So I guess I would,
I would think it lives in graphite once</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/123-3
00:14:12.307 --> 00:14:17.233
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>we have it and then we apply it to. Sorry,
maybe I'm not understanding the question.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/125-0
00:14:17.393 --> 00:14:20.029
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah,
let me rephrase the question more simply.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/125-1
00:14:20.029 --> 00:14:23.379
<v Miller, Jeremy>And now I'm not articulating myself very
well at the moment,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/125-2
00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:26.784
<v Miller, Jeremy>but so the there's one problem which
could be that, you know,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/125-3
00:14:26.784 --> 00:14:29.804
<v Miller, Jeremy>people just don't know how sites relate
to each other.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/125-4
00:14:29.804 --> 00:14:33.978
<v Miller, Jeremy>And then then there's another more
fundamental problem is people don't know</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/124-0
00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:30.593
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/125-5
00:14:33.978 --> 00:14:36.833
<v Miller, Jeremy>what it means for a site to relate to
another site.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/126-0
00:14:37.273 --> 00:14:38.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>People don't have the.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/128-0
00:14:37.673 --> 00:14:39.519
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yes,
and they have differing and they have</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/128-1
00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:42.179
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>differing definitions.
So one person is saying one saying the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/127-0
00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:42.153
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yes.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/128-2
00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:45.613
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>same term and they think and it's meaning
two different things to two different</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/128-3
00:14:45.613 --> 00:14:45.913
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>people.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/132-0
00:14:45.753 --> 00:14:50.159
<v Miller, Jeremy>So there's value in us as Norstella
saying, here's what a site is,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/132-1
00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:53.119
<v Miller, Jeremy>here's what a relationship is. Here's,
yeah,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/129-0
00:14:51.233 --> 00:14:53.793
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>We commit to it. We give you definitions.
Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/132-2
00:14:53.119 --> 00:14:57.854
<v Miller, Jeremy>we here's a set of definitions and
taxonomies which you can then we can</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/132-3
00:14:57.854 --> 00:15:01.405
<v Miller, Jeremy>populate relation.
We can build you a data structure.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/132-4
00:15:01.405 --> 00:15:05.153
<v Miller, Jeremy>We could build a data structure that
leverages those to.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/130-0
00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:03.073
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/134-0
00:15:05.273 --> 00:15:08.468
<v Miller, Jeremy>create networks, meetings, information,
value, blah, blah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/131-0
00:15:08.433 --> 00:15:08.633
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/134-1
00:15:08.468 --> 00:15:12.691
<v Miller, Jeremy>You could also just take that set of
definitions and apply it to your data or</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/134-2
00:15:12.691 --> 00:15:15.073
<v Miller, Jeremy>other data you want to buy, whatever.
Okay.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/133-0
00:15:13.553 --> 00:15:13.713
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/135-0
00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:22.876
<v Bayed, Sofian>So it's it's almost like building A
taxonomy based on relationship data that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/135-1
00:15:22.876 --> 00:15:25.873
<v Bayed, Sofian>we see happening, right? So.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/137-0
00:15:25.033 --> 00:15:27.774
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yes,
but I want to come at it from the other</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/137-1
00:15:27.774 --> 00:15:31.367
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>direction at first.
I want to commit to our definitions of</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/137-2
00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:35.569
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>what we as Norstella think,
because that's the other squishy part is</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/136-0
00:15:32.913 --> 00:15:33.033
<v Bayed, Sofian>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/137-3
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>it's not just saying, well,
I want to map relationships that exist</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/137-4
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.913
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>like with existing definitions.
So I'm trying to think of an example.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/140-0
00:15:45.433 --> 00:15:49.023
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Like trial similarity or something.
It's not just saying like which factors</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/140-1
00:15:49.023 --> 00:15:52.566
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>are going to come up most often.
I think we need to even go back up a step</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/140-2
00:15:52.566 --> 00:15:56.440
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>and say like this is what we are looking.
This is what we are looking for because</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/140-3
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>we don't even have a definition
definition at this point.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/138-0
00:15:59.113 --> 00:15:59.633
<v Bayed, Sofian>Right, OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/140-4
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.833
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>We don't even know what to look at.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/142-0
00:16:01.113 --> 00:16:01.233
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>But.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/143-0
00:16:02.073 --> 00:16:07.146
<v Gohel, Suril>It's fair to say that we want to go back,
come out and say like this is what we</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/139-0
00:16:02.193 --> 00:16:02.433
<v Bayed, Sofian>Right.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/141-0
00:16:02.553 --> 00:16:02.753
<v Bayed, Sofian>So.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/143-1
00:16:07.146 --> 00:16:12.219
<v Gohel, Suril>think is important when you connect sites
or when you frame a network of sites.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/143-2
00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:15.643
<v Gohel, Suril>In other words,
just P is being overlapping with each</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/143-3
00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:20.589
<v Gohel, Suril>other. It is not a good enough metrics,
but we need to add other metrics that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/143-4
00:16:20.589 --> 00:16:21.033
<v Gohel, Suril>define.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/144-0
00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:24.633
<v Gohel, Suril>A coherence between the sites or that we
already.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/145-0
00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:25.307
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah, yeah.
I think that that feels like the next</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/145-1
00:16:25.307 --> 00:16:28.676
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>step. Once we have definitions,
like then we start saying, OK,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/145-2
00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:32.580
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>we can now see the relationships and what
do we see as the most valuable</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/145-3
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.842
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>relationship, right?
Like these are the metrics we would use</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/145-4
00:16:35.842 --> 00:16:37.713
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>to pull out. We consider these are.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/146-0
00:16:37.993 --> 00:16:40.507
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Closer, further, whatever.
You know what I mean?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/146-1
00:16:40.507 --> 00:16:43.535
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>It's like you're right,
just cuz they have a relationship,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/146-2
00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:47.126
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>it doesn't necessarily mean it's a a
valuable one in depending on the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/146-3
00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:50.667
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>definition. But yeah, what do we?
And then that's a cool way to say,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/146-4
00:16:50.667 --> 00:16:54.053
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>is it number of interactions?
Like I could say see for a referral</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/146-5
00:16:54.053 --> 00:16:57.593
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>network if you're referring someone
preferentially and you have 100.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/147-0
00:16:57.593 --> 00:17:00.075
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Referrals.
That's better than someone who refers</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/147-1
00:17:00.075 --> 00:17:03.012
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>twice. So just because they do,
they have a relationship.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/147-2
00:17:03.012 --> 00:17:06.355
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>It's more like there's there's quality
and quantity on top of it,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/147-3
00:17:06.355 --> 00:17:10.153
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>which would be really cool to do too.
But yeah, that's that's interesting.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/149-0
00:17:13.753 --> 00:17:17.505
<v Miller, Jeremy>So the one.
So let's say we create some definition or</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/149-1
00:17:17.505 --> 00:17:22.994
<v Miller, Jeremy>definitions of what it means for networks
to be, for sites to be in a network,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/149-2
00:17:22.994 --> 00:17:27.441
<v Miller, Jeremy>members of the same network or not
members of the same network.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/149-3
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:31.193
<v Miller, Jeremy>So one use of that that we've talked
about so far is.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/150-0
00:17:31.753 --> 00:17:36.724
<v Miller, Jeremy>I'm looking for sites for my trial.
I have a site that I've identified either</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/150-1
00:17:36.724 --> 00:17:41.504
<v Miller, Jeremy>because I've worked with before,
because I whatever reason I know it's one</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/150-2
00:17:41.504 --> 00:17:45.455
<v Miller, Jeremy>I want to work with.
Here's their here's ten other sites that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/150-3
00:17:45.455 --> 00:17:48.833
<v Miller, Jeremy>are part of that same network that I
might consider.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/152-0
00:17:48.553 --> 00:17:51.476
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK. Yes, yes, that does make sense.
Absolutely.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/151-0
00:17:50.193 --> 00:17:53.353
<v Miller, Jeremy>Does that make sense? OK, so.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/152-1
00:17:51.476 --> 00:17:54.824
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I could see coming at it from the other
direction too.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/152-2
00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:58.721
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>If I have a set of trials that were
successful in this disease,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/152-3
00:17:58.721 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I know they were,
they were successful according to my</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/152-4
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.358
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>parameters.
I want to see the site networks that were</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/152-5
00:18:05.358 --> 00:18:07.793
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>used most often with this set of trials.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/153-0
00:18:10.353 --> 00:18:11.393
<v Bayed, Sofian>Makes sense, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/154-0
00:18:11.673 --> 00:18:15.879
<v Miller, Jeremy>In order to select them to to attempt to
get them to be sites for my trial and</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/154-1
00:18:15.879 --> 00:18:18.753
<v Miller, Jeremy>increase the probability that my trial is
successful.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/155-0
00:18:19.193 --> 00:18:22.513
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>If I'm a trial person or if I'm like a.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/157-0
00:18:23.753 --> 00:18:25.485
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>CRO,
I want to go build a relationship with</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/157-1
00:18:25.485 --> 00:18:28.162
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>them because I know that they're going to,
do you know what I mean?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/157-2
00:18:28.162 --> 00:18:31.233
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I think I could see some other reasons
from other types of clients too, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/156-0
00:18:29.033 --> 00:18:32.473
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/160-0
00:18:31.353 --> 00:18:37.721
<v Bayed, Sofian>So it it's almost like some kind of site
success metric based on different</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/160-1
00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:44.513
<v Bayed, Sofian>parameters like indication, you know,
location, other other entities basically.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/158-0
00:18:40.513 --> 00:18:41.073
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/159-0
00:18:44.633 --> 00:18:47.153
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah,
cause more and more we're getting into</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/159-1
00:18:47.153 --> 00:18:47.433
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>like.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/163-0
00:18:48.313 --> 00:18:51.948
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Like CROS have relationships with
preferentially with sites and then</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/163-1
00:18:51.948 --> 00:18:56.216
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>there's certain like entities that will
try to go out and get patients for sites</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/163-2
00:18:56.216 --> 00:18:59.693
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>like there's a middle man,
like I think there's a couple of other</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/163-3
00:18:59.693 --> 00:19:03.433
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>ancillary areas that are kind of cropping
up with these site networks.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/161-0
00:19:00.433 --> 00:19:00.673
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/162-0
00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:02.473
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/164-0
00:19:03.513 --> 00:19:07.200
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>But nobody has a handle on like where
they are, how they relate.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/164-1
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.433
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And it's interesting, but yeah,
very nebulous right now.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/165-0
00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:17.225
<v Bayed, Sofian>Makes sense. We had protocol recommender.
Now we're gonna have site recommender.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/168-0
00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:18.628
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.
I could very much see there being like a,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/165-1
00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:18.193
<v Bayed, Sofian>That's great.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/168-1
00:19:18.628 --> 00:19:21.248
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>yeah,
site network recommender and like a</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/168-2
00:19:21.248 --> 00:19:24.118
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>higher level. Yeah,
this is our preferential.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/166-0
00:19:21.913 --> 00:19:22.273
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/168-3
00:19:24.118 --> 00:19:27.113
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>They they get a tier one versus a Tier 2,
yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/167-0
00:19:28.313 --> 00:19:29.273
<v Bayed, Sofian>Makes sense.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/169-0
00:19:30.353 --> 00:19:31.153
<v Bayed, Sofian>Very interesting.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/171-0
00:19:33.753 --> 00:19:37.474
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And then I think the other technical
challenge is at that point,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/171-1
00:19:37.474 --> 00:19:42.283
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>once we have all of this, like how do we,
how do we apply it to all of the existing</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/171-2
00:19:42.283 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>data? Cause the data sets are so large.
That's the other thing in the back of my</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/171-3
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.553
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>head is I I can't do it manually very
easily.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/172-0
00:19:50.153 --> 00:19:53.420
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And I don't know if there's a better way
to do that once we have. Yeah,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/172-1
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.961
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I I don't know.
I don't know what to do with it at that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/173-0
00:19:54.473 --> 00:19:56.553
<v Bayed, Sofian>First, that's.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/175-0
00:19:54.953 --> 00:20:01.524
<v Miller, Jeremy>So Surreal and Sofian are going to be mad
at me, but scale's not a problem.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/172-2
00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:56.233
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>point.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/174-0
00:19:59.433 --> 00:20:02.353
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK, awesome. Great. Made my day.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/175-1
00:20:01.524 --> 00:20:05.673
<v Miller, Jeremy>Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/176-0
00:20:05.713 --> 00:20:05.833
<v Miller, Jeremy>But.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/178-0
00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:10.074
<v Bayed, Sofian>Jeremy here, I, I, I, you know,
I think we're not using Excel if that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/178-1
00:20:10.074 --> 00:20:12.273
<v Bayed, Sofian>makes you, uh, feel more comfortable.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/180-0
00:20:12.993 --> 00:20:15.286
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>No, no, no.
It's more of like a primary endpoints</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/177-0
00:20:13.873 --> 00:20:14.153
<v Gohel, Suril>Yes.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/180-1
00:20:15.286 --> 00:20:18.267
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>problem, Sophian, right?
Like we're going to end up having to go</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/180-2
00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:21.340
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>back and do it to everything eventually.
I can just see it coming,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/180-3
00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.633
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>even if we restrict it to a certain set
to start.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/183-0
00:20:23.593 --> 00:20:27.668
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah, and and if scale is a problem,
we could even focus on a given</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/183-1
00:20:27.668 --> 00:20:30.664
<v Bayed, Sofian>therapeutic area or a given indication.
You know,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/181-0
00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:29.513
<v Gohel, Suril>Mhm.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/183-2
00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:33.600
<v Bayed, Sofian>we can be smart about it for a proof of
concept.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/183-3
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.393
<v Bayed, Sofian>We don't need to do it for every single
indication or every single size, right?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/182-0
00:20:39.033 --> 00:20:40.353
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK, OK, cool.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/185-0
00:20:43.953 --> 00:20:49.629
<v Bayed, Sofian>The the good thing is that the fusion
data that we're going to have is going to</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/185-1
00:20:49.629 --> 00:20:53.743
<v Bayed, Sofian>be highly structured,
way better than what we had before.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/184-0
00:20:50.153 --> 00:20:50.553
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/185-2
00:20:53.743 --> 00:20:58.993
<v Bayed, Sofian>It's going to be connected to different
masters, different data sets, so.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/187-0
00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:04.463
<v Bayed, Sofian>It will be great from a a technical
standpoint because this is exactly I</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/187-1
00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:10.233
<v Bayed, Sofian>think the value of fusion being able to
link different data points together.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/186-0
00:21:07.313 --> 00:21:08.473
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/190-0
00:21:10.073 --> 00:21:12.756
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah, no, it's actually really exciting,
especially kind of.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/190-1
00:21:12.756 --> 00:21:15.615
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I know we ran into a couple of bumps with
the primary endpoints,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/190-2
00:21:15.615 --> 00:21:18.253
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>like nothing we could have known about,
but now that we've,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/190-3
00:21:18.253 --> 00:21:20.936
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>it's almost like a simpler primary
endpoints problem, right?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/190-4
00:21:20.936 --> 00:21:23.135
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Like we're going to need to do it to the
big set,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/190-5
00:21:23.135 --> 00:21:25.378
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but we already did it with once with
those things.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/190-6
00:21:25.378 --> 00:21:26.873
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>We already can do that piece, but.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/192-0
00:21:27.473 --> 00:21:30.890
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah,
I just don't know how to get from point A</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/189-0
00:21:28.513 --> 00:21:28.793
<v Bayed, Sofian>Sorry.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/191-0
00:21:30.753 --> 00:21:32.273
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah, no, that makes sense.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/192-1
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:31.673
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>to point B.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/193-0
00:21:36.113 --> 00:21:36.673
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Cool. Thank you.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/194-0
00:21:38.153 --> 00:21:38.393
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/197-0
00:21:38.273 --> 00:21:41.133
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So from my side, yeah,
we're starting the the kind of the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/195-0
00:21:39.033 --> 00:21:39.113
<v Miller, Jeremy>So.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/197-1
00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:44.732
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>background thought work on what we want
to commit to for definitions and</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/197-2
00:21:44.732 --> 00:21:47.788
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>structure next week.
So I'm hoping to have at least something</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/196-0
00:21:46.793 --> 00:21:46.913
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/197-3
00:21:47.788 --> 00:21:50.401
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>fairly quickly.
But I was trying to think through if</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/197-4
00:21:50.401 --> 00:21:54.246
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>there was a piece we could do to kind of
jumpstart things right away, Jeremy,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/197-5
00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:57.993
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>to your point of trying to like get
something going and I think there were.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/198-0
00:21:58.193 --> 00:22:02.916
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Referral section might be the way to go
because I know that we can pull out that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/198-1
00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:07.172
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>relationship from the RWD. Well,
I I understand that we can pull out the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/198-2
00:22:07.172 --> 00:22:12.011
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>relationship from RWD of the referrals.
If there was a way to somehow start there,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/198-3
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:16.675
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>that might be a thing that doesn't need
as much structure from my side and then</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/198-4
00:22:16.675 --> 00:22:17.433
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>that kind of.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/199-0
00:22:17.553 --> 00:22:22.194
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Gives me some time to get the definitions
and stuff in place because we are we know</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/199-1
00:22:22.194 --> 00:22:25.233
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>that that referral information is already
in that set.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/200-0
00:22:26.273 --> 00:22:27.313
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah, um.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/201-0
00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:35.593
<v Miller, Jeremy>That just sounds too easy.
It just sounds too easy.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/203-0
00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:42.562
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK, so stepping back a little bit,
So what what do we need in practical</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/203-1
00:22:42.562 --> 00:22:47.840
<v Miller, Jeremy>terms over the next,
let's just say week or two to be able to</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/203-2
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.033
<v Miller, Jeremy>have something before we all go away at
the end of the year?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/204-0
00:22:53.593 --> 00:22:58.376
<v Miller, Jeremy>So we need a working definition of what
it means for sites to be connected for</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/204-1
00:22:58.376 --> 00:23:02.069
<v Miller, Jeremy>some use case or set of use cases.
And you've said that Gee,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/204-2
00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:07.033
<v Miller, Jeremy>you're gonna you're working on that now
with folks and there's some conversation.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/209-0
00:23:05.793 --> 00:23:09.022
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>We're starting it.
I definitely won't be within two weeks.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/205-0
00:23:08.193 --> 00:23:12.313
<v Miller, Jeremy>Working working definition is fine.
Working definition is fine.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/209-1
00:23:09.022 --> 00:23:12.908
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>It's a it's a bear and you're well, OK,
there's a there's a lot there.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/209-2
00:23:12.908 --> 00:23:16.519
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I know it seems fairly straightforward
come up with a definition,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/209-3
00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:20.897
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but there's so much I think that we need
to consider in on multiple definitions</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/209-4
00:23:20.897 --> 00:23:23.688
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>that I don't know that I can do that in
two weeks,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/206-0
00:23:22.273 --> 00:23:22.873
<v Miller, Jeremy>Mhm.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/209-5
00:23:23.688 --> 00:23:25.713
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>which is kind of why I was trying to.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/207-0
00:23:25.153 --> 00:23:25.273
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/211-0
00:23:25.713 --> 00:23:30.201
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Figure out a middle ground.
I also don't have any data once I have</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/208-0
00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:28.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>Right.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/211-1
00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:34.220
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>that for the fusion side.
So what I meant for the RWD data,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/211-2
00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.110
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I guess that would be my curious part too,
is I don't have access to it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/211-3
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.598
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I can't see it. Whatever they can,
whatever they have for referral</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/210-0
00:23:42.313 --> 00:23:42.953
<v Miller, Jeremy>Mhm.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/211-4
00:23:43.598 --> 00:23:45.473
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>relationships might be very.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/212-0
00:23:45.553 --> 00:23:49.259
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Helpful for us to inform definitions and
structure of a category for that stuff.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/212-1
00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:52.553
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I don't know what is in there though,
so I can't see it. I don't, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/213-0
00:23:51.993 --> 00:23:54.582
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah,
we can walk you through that at a high</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/213-1
00:23:54.582 --> 00:23:58.149
<v Miller, Jeremy>level and we have access to that.
Surreal has access to that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/213-2
00:23:58.149 --> 00:24:01.429
<v Miller, Jeremy>So when you say you don't have data for
the future site,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/213-3
00:24:01.429 --> 00:24:04.593
<v Miller, Jeremy>does that mean there's no such thing as a
site master?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/214-0
00:24:05.793 --> 00:24:08.473
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>There is an org master that contains
clinical sites.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/217-0
00:24:08.193 --> 00:24:16.353
<v Bayed, Sofian>So the Yeah, exactly. No, no,
I was going to say the exact same.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/215-0
00:24:09.593 --> 00:24:09.753
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/216-0
00:24:09.753 --> 00:24:11.273
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>They have. Sorry, go ahead, Sufian.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/219-0
00:24:14.913 --> 00:24:21.221
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>They they have a parent-child structure
and relationship right now, but the site.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/218-0
00:24:18.393 --> 00:24:18.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/219-1
00:24:21.221 --> 00:24:25.836
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So I have the bones in place to apply A
tag, a network tag.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/219-2
00:24:25.836 --> 00:24:30.990
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I don't have the taxonomy.
I I have a very very limited list right</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/219-3
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.913
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>now of what.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/221-0
00:24:32.353 --> 00:24:35.500
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Would go there and I don't know that it's
going to be sufficient.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/221-1
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.645
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So I guess that's the other kind of
problem.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/221-2
00:24:37.645 --> 00:24:41.697
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Until I know how many levels and what the
taxonomy looks like and all of that stuff,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/221-3
00:24:41.697 --> 00:24:44.033
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I don't know what I need to apply to the
master.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/220-0
00:24:44.033 --> 00:24:44.153
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/224-0
00:24:54.673 --> 00:24:58.328
<v Gohel, Suril>Like I I'm new here,
so when we say organizational master,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/224-1
00:24:58.328 --> 00:25:03.037
<v Gohel, Suril>let's say if there is Yale, right?
So that means that we'll have a a master</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/224-2
00:25:03.037 --> 00:25:07.621
<v Gohel, Suril>data set for Yale and then every site
within the Yale network would have.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/224-3
00:25:07.621 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Gohel, Suril>Would we consider them as sites
individually or am I thinking about it</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/224-4
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.073
<v Gohel, Suril>completely wrong?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/225-0
00:25:14.673 --> 00:25:16.713
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I'm I'm sorry, can you say that again?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/226-0
00:25:15.713 --> 00:25:18.273
<v Miller, Jeremy>I think he's asking what is what is a
site?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/228-0
00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:22.820
<v Gohel, Suril>What is the organizational master like?
What is that organizational level and</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/229-0
00:25:22.353 --> 00:25:26.719
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Oh, OK. Well, the, yeah,
I'm not the PO for the org master,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/228-1
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.113
<v Gohel, Suril>what is the site level?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/229-1
00:25:26.719 --> 00:25:31.740
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but my understanding is that the
organization definition of a parent</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/229-2
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:36.980
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>organization is that they are in a
standalone entity that has financial</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/229-3
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:42.073
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>independence and there's a couple of
other financial pieces in there.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/231-0
00:25:42.313 --> 00:25:48.141
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So mostly the clinical sites are child
have a child relationship to the parent</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/231-1
00:25:48.141 --> 00:25:54.190
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>because the parent is usually the kind of
overarching financial thing that drives</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/231-2
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.288
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>it.
So you do have stand-alone sites that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/231-3
00:25:57.288 --> 00:25:59.353
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>have themselves as a parent.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/230-0
00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:00.033
<v Miller, Jeremy>Mhm.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/232-0
00:26:00.873 --> 00:26:04.562
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>It doesn't happen super often.
Mostly the the sites are have a</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/232-1
00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:07.139
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>controlling organization in the org
master,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/232-2
00:26:07.139 --> 00:26:11.882
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>which I do think needs to feed into this
somehow, but it's not really a network,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/232-3
00:26:11.882 --> 00:26:13.873
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>it's more of a owned by situation.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/235-0
00:26:12.113 --> 00:26:16.978
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah, yeah, exactly.
It's ownership relationships and and I</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/233-0
00:26:15.193 --> 00:26:15.913
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/235-1
00:26:16.978 --> 00:26:22.411
<v Bayed, Sofian>think it's very incomplete.
I'm sure there are other relationships</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/234-0
00:26:19.673 --> 00:26:19.993
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/235-2
00:26:22.411 --> 00:26:28.167
<v Bayed, Sofian>that are like ownership relationships
that are happening in real life,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/235-3
00:26:28.167 --> 00:26:30.113
<v Bayed, Sofian>but not in the database.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/238-0
00:26:29.553 --> 00:26:32.122
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yes, yes, yes.
We've done a lot of clean up,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/236-0
00:26:30.953 --> 00:26:31.113
<v Bayed, Sofian>Right.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/238-1
00:26:32.122 --> 00:26:36.517
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but I think it I I totally take your
point and completely agree that there's</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/238-2
00:26:36.517 --> 00:26:40.740
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>probably more that can be done there and
it's only a two level hierarchy,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/238-3
00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.393
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>which I would argue probably needs to be
more like 3 or 4, but.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/237-0
00:26:45.873 --> 00:26:46.113
<v Gohel, Suril>And.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/239-0
00:26:52.073 --> 00:26:53.353
<v Miller, Jeremy>So.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/240-0
00:26:52.273 --> 00:26:56.993
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>It's thorny, right, Jeremy?
It's a thorny problem.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/242-0
00:26:54.833 --> 00:27:00.153
<v Miller, Jeremy>Of course it is. Yeah, I just try to take.
I want one thorn at a time. So um.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/241-0
00:26:58.433 --> 00:26:58.873
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/243-0
00:27:04.833 --> 00:27:07.193
<v Miller, Jeremy>Providers and sites are not one to one.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/244-0
00:27:08.073 --> 00:27:08.473
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Correct.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/245-0
00:27:09.233 --> 00:27:14.229
<v Miller, Jeremy>Is is there value?
Would there be value in since we don't</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/245-1
00:27:14.229 --> 00:27:21.465
<v Miller, Jeremy>yet have that so basic a basic definition
or understanding of what does it mean for</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/245-2
00:27:21.465 --> 00:27:26.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>sites to be connected?
What if we did a a provider network?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/246-0
00:27:27.153 --> 00:27:32.461
<v Miller, Jeremy>What if we started there and we said
let's try to figure out what makes</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/246-1
00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:37.252
<v Miller, Jeremy>providers connected and you know,
there are the first, you know,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/246-2
00:27:37.252 --> 00:27:42.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>many ways to do that. Patients, diseases,
drugs, relationships to sites.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/247-0
00:27:42.793 --> 00:27:42.873
<v Miller, Jeremy>Um.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/248-0
00:27:44.873 --> 00:27:45.513
<v Miller, Jeremy>For all that works.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/249-0
00:27:46.993 --> 00:27:52.713
<v Miller, Jeremy>Does that become then an input or a facet
or some other related useful information?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/253-0
00:27:53.153 --> 00:27:55.050
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah,
I definitely think that's part of it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/250-0
00:27:54.153 --> 00:27:54.393
<v Miller, Jeremy>4.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/253-1
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.379
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I totally agree.
And that's kind of what I think that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/251-0
00:27:56.073 --> 00:27:56.473
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/253-2
00:27:57.379 --> 00:28:00.267
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>that's probably a better,
more elegant way of what I was trying to</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/253-3
00:28:00.267 --> 00:28:03.717
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>get at with the referral piece is that
feels a little bit more manageable right</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/253-4
00:28:03.717 --> 00:28:06.088
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>now. So yeah,
I totally agree and it probably can span</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/253-5
00:28:06.088 --> 00:28:08.373
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>much wider than just referrals.
Like if you want to,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/253-6
00:28:08.373 --> 00:28:10.313
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>we do have the site to person
relationships.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/254-0
00:28:10.433 --> 00:28:16.038
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>And we do capture as they move between
organizations. So that data is in fusion.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/252-0
00:28:12.193 --> 00:28:12.313
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/254-1
00:28:16.038 --> 00:28:21.574
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>You could go back and see previous sites
and organizations they were affiliated</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/254-2
00:28:21.574 --> 00:28:24.549
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>with.
We haven't done anything with it yet</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/257-0
00:28:22.873 --> 00:28:27.533
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah. And and I know even in one, right.
And even at one point in time,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/254-3
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:25.033
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>though.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/255-0
00:28:25.993 --> 00:28:26.273
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/257-1
00:28:27.533 --> 00:28:32.258
<v Miller, Jeremy>a provider might be affiliated with
multiple sites. So yeah, so Surreal,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/256-0
00:28:29.393 --> 00:28:31.593
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yes, yes, they might. Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/257-2
00:28:32.258 --> 00:28:35.300
<v Miller, Jeremy>this is a question I don't know the
answer to,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/257-3
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.313
<v Miller, Jeremy>but is it do we know and maybe you don't
yet, but in the RWD?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/258-0
00:28:40.793 --> 00:28:45.147
<v Miller, Jeremy>Or clinical visit. Do we know?
Let's say a provider works at, you know,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/258-1
00:28:45.147 --> 00:28:48.715
<v Miller, Jeremy>has their own private practice and works
at two hospitals.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/258-2
00:28:48.715 --> 00:28:51.073
<v Miller, Jeremy>Do we know where that visit took place?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/260-0
00:28:52.673 --> 00:28:58.513
<v Gohel, Suril>I don't know the answer to that,
but I think we can figure that out. Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/259-0
00:28:55.313 --> 00:28:56.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/261-0
00:28:58.393 --> 00:29:01.673
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>That would be cool. That would be, yeah,
a great first step, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/264-0
00:28:58.553 --> 00:29:03.776
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, I think maybe we should start there.
I think maybe we should start with the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/264-1
00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:07.726
<v Miller, Jeremy>provider level and try to come up with
some way of, you know,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/264-2
00:29:07.726 --> 00:29:11.993
<v Miller, Jeremy>for lack of a more elegant way of saying
it, clustering providers.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/263-0
00:29:12.593 --> 00:29:13.273
<v Gohel, Suril>Mhm.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/262-0
00:29:12.713 --> 00:29:12.793
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Uh.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/265-0
00:29:14.553 --> 00:29:17.665
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>No, that'd be cool.
That'd be really interesting too,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/265-1
00:29:17.665 --> 00:29:19.393
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>if we could somehow have them.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/266-0
00:29:20.593 --> 00:29:25.124
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Have the relationship with the site with
the referral because then that could get</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/266-1
00:29:25.124 --> 00:29:25.953
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>matched to our.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/269-0
00:29:26.833 --> 00:29:30.902
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Site information and fusion.
That also might be an interesting</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/269-1
00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:34.713
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>bridging way between the data too. OK,
that would be cool.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/267-0
00:29:32.713 --> 00:29:33.033
<v Gohel, Suril>Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/268-0
00:29:34.433 --> 00:29:34.953
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/271-0
00:29:36.393 --> 00:29:39.307
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah,
and and there could be some pretty short</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/270-0
00:29:36.673 --> 00:29:37.233
<v Miller, Jeremy>And.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/271-1
00:29:39.307 --> 00:29:41.725
<v Miller, Jeremy>step.
Let's say we had a robust way of</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/271-2
00:29:41.725 --> 00:29:45.631
<v Miller, Jeremy>clustering providers,
having similarity metrics and and having</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/271-3
00:29:45.631 --> 00:29:49.351
<v Miller, Jeremy>networks and so forth.
There could be a a short step to a a</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/271-4
00:29:49.351 --> 00:29:51.273
<v Miller, Jeremy>first version of sites just by.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/272-0
00:29:51.633 --> 00:29:54.073
<v Miller, Jeremy>Aggregating those metrics along different
axes.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/273-0
00:29:55.953 --> 00:29:56.713
<v Gohel, Suril>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/274-0
00:29:57.633 --> 00:30:01.093
<v Miller, Jeremy>And also surreal.
I think that that's also going to be</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/274-1
00:30:01.093 --> 00:30:04.113
<v Miller, Jeremy>useful for all the things that MIT wants
to do.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/275-0
00:30:04.913 --> 00:30:09.927
<v Gohel, Suril>I agree and I think that even if there is
like not a one-to-one relationship</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/275-1
00:30:09.927 --> 00:30:14.484
<v Gohel, Suril>between provider and sites,
I think at that point we'll probably just</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/275-2
00:30:14.484 --> 00:30:19.693
<v Gohel, Suril>at the first pass just want to find like
a simpler aggregation methodology like</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/275-3
00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:19.953
<v Gohel, Suril>hey.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/278-0
00:30:19.993 --> 00:30:24.393
<v Gohel, Suril>If the the numbers are like 60% or higher
at one site,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/278-1
00:30:24.393 --> 00:30:30.793
<v Gohel, Suril>then that's the primary site and then
everything else becomes secondary one MVP</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/276-0
00:30:29.753 --> 00:30:30.073
Yeah.

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/278-2
00:30:30.793 --> 00:30:31.753
<v Gohel, Suril>level, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/277-0
00:30:31.513 --> 00:30:31.873
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/280-0
00:30:40.153 --> 00:30:42.575
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK,
so back to trying to turn this into</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/279-0
00:30:40.793 --> 00:30:41.233
Yes.

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/280-1
00:30:42.575 --> 00:30:47.056
<v Miller, Jeremy>something practical and concrete.
So our working definition of what we're</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/280-2
00:30:47.056 --> 00:30:50.568
<v Miller, Jeremy>trying to define,
we've decided it's going to be provider</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/280-3
00:30:50.568 --> 00:30:51.113
<v Miller, Jeremy>networks.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/281-0
00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:57.979
<v Miller, Jeremy>And that in the meantime,
she's gonna go away and work with all the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/281-1
00:30:57.979 --> 00:31:02.673
<v Miller, Jeremy>smart people and define what a a site
network means and then get back to us.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/282-0
00:31:05.593 --> 00:31:10.402
<v Miller, Jeremy>Surreal has access to the data,
the RGBD data.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/282-1
00:31:10.402 --> 00:31:18.382
<v Miller, Jeremy>What data are there data or what data are
there in fusion that we can use the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/282-2
00:31:18.382 --> 00:31:20.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>leverage to make this?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/283-0
00:31:20.713 --> 00:31:22.473
<v Miller, Jeremy>more robust or more complete.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/285-0
00:31:23.033 --> 00:31:25.999
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Sure.
The person master is probably going to be</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/285-1
00:31:25.999 --> 00:31:29.212
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>the place where you're going to find the
providers.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/285-2
00:31:29.212 --> 00:31:33.352
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>It's in UAT right now and it'll be in
production on November 11th.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/285-3
00:31:33.352 --> 00:31:37.121
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>All goes well, knock on wood. Yeah.
And and in the meantime,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/284-0
00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:33.953
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/285-4
00:31:37.121 --> 00:31:38.233
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>we'll come at the.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/288-0
00:31:38.713 --> 00:31:41.064
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Kind of overarching definitions and
structure.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/288-1
00:31:41.064 --> 00:31:45.217
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I do think it'll end up encompassing the
provider stuff that you're talking about,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/288-2
00:31:45.217 --> 00:31:49.119
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but in a way that hopefully we can tag
and apply. I don't think it, you know,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/288-3
00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:53.121
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>changes anything that it sounds like
you're going to do as a first pass anyway,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/288-4
00:31:53.121 --> 00:31:56.472
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but but we'll have that.
We'll have a kind of a hopefully what I'm</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/287-0
00:31:53.753 --> 00:31:54.273
<v Miller, Jeremy>Mhm.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/288-5
00:31:56.472 --> 00:31:58.073
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>hoping for is to come out of it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/289-0
00:31:58.393 --> 00:32:02.456
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>With a robust set of definitions and
relationships and hierarchy and</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/289-1
00:32:02.456 --> 00:32:05.753
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>categories that we can use and apply
across everything.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/290-0
00:32:06.353 --> 00:32:09.331
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK,
what's the what are the data sources for</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/290-1
00:32:09.331 --> 00:32:13.036
<v Miller, Jeremy>the person master?
How does how does information get in</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/290-2
00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:13.433
<v Miller, Jeremy>there?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/293-0
00:32:14.713 --> 00:32:21.062
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Currently it is primarily investigators
and industry staff and trial support</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/293-1
00:32:21.062 --> 00:32:24.854
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>staff.
So it's based off of usually the trial</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/293-2
00:32:24.854 --> 00:32:30.295
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>information, public sources,
so trial registries, press releases,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/291-0
00:32:27.633 --> 00:32:27.753
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/293-3
00:32:30.295 --> 00:32:33.593
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>medical websites, NPI provider database.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/292-0
00:32:31.633 --> 00:32:32.073
<v Miller, Jeremy>Got it.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/294-0
00:32:34.313 --> 00:32:37.259
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah, I'd love PubMed.
I'd love to get that more robust.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/294-1
00:32:37.259 --> 00:32:41.394
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I think there's a couple of places we
could get more data that we didn't have a</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/294-2
00:32:41.394 --> 00:32:45.270
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>place for until now because this is
primarily data that was stored in star</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/294-3
00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.939
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>for site trove and but obviously person
master could be more than just</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/294-4
00:32:48.939 --> 00:32:51.833
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>investigators,
but that's the primary source right now.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/296-0
00:32:52.353 --> 00:32:57.828
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK, OK. Yeah, I can definitely see that.
I can definitely imagine that real-world</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/296-1
00:32:57.828 --> 00:33:02.368
<v Miller, Jeremy>data would be able to augment that,
but those two things are gonna,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/296-2
00:33:02.368 --> 00:33:07.175
<v Miller, Jeremy>they're gonna, they're not gonna.
There will be places where they don't</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/295-0
00:33:03.993 --> 00:33:04.473
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/296-3
00:33:07.175 --> 00:33:10.113
<v Miller, Jeremy>overlap and they can compliment each
other.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/299-0
00:33:09.953 --> 00:33:14.571
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah, yeah, no, definitely be awesome.
I think MPI number is probably the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/297-0
00:33:10.273 --> 00:33:11.233
<v Miller, Jeremy>For sure.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/299-1
00:33:14.571 --> 00:33:18.690
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>easiest entry into that.
So if anything you're running surreal is</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/299-2
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:22.435
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>can include that,
that might make our kind of data mappings</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/299-3
00:33:22.435 --> 00:33:23.433
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>a little easier.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/298-0
00:33:22.753 --> 00:33:23.033
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/300-0
00:33:25.033 --> 00:33:28.515
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK,
so we have a high level definition of</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/300-1
00:33:28.515 --> 00:33:32.412
<v Miller, Jeremy>what we're trying to do.
We have data sources.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/300-2
00:33:32.412 --> 00:33:37.884
<v Miller, Jeremy>I think the other thing that we kind of
need is, you know, again,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/300-3
00:33:37.884 --> 00:33:43.273
<v Miller, Jeremy>for lack of a better term,
some sort of objective function like.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/301-0
00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:47.776
<v Miller, Jeremy>What do we get? What would we look at?
So let's say Surreal goes away and he</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/301-1
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:51.464
<v Miller, Jeremy>comes back and he produces a table and
the table has like provider one,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/301-2
00:33:51.464 --> 00:33:55.407
<v Miller, Jeremy>provider two and then some of the data
about how they're already or it has a</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/301-3
00:33:55.407 --> 00:33:58.889
<v Miller, Jeremy>provider and has all their relationships
with strength, confidence,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/301-4
00:33:58.889 --> 00:33:59.913
<v Miller, Jeremy>blah blah blah blah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/302-0
00:33:59.993 --> 00:34:00.113
<v Miller, Jeremy>Um.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/303-0
00:34:02.153 --> 00:34:08.245
<v Miller, Jeremy>What do we look at or what do we measure
to understand if this is telling us what</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/303-1
00:34:08.245 --> 00:34:09.433
<v Miller, Jeremy>we want to know?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/305-0
00:34:11.833 --> 00:34:15.676
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I'd probably without being able to see
our WT data directly.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/305-1
00:34:15.676 --> 00:34:18.763
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I'm kind of making a bit of a guess in
the dark,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/305-2
00:34:18.763 --> 00:34:22.795
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but for me it would be kind of like a
number of hits situation,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/305-3
00:34:22.795 --> 00:34:27.393
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>like how many times that they are
interacting. So if you've got someone.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/306-0
00:34:28.153 --> 00:34:32.199
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>A provider referring to one other
specific provider more often.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/306-1
00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:37.193
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>To me that's a stronger relationship and
I guess you could expand that to say.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/308-0
00:34:38.953 --> 00:34:41.827
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>If you could aggregate the sites within a
network,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/308-1
00:34:41.827 --> 00:34:46.334
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>how often do they refer within within
site network versus outside site network?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/308-2
00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:49.827
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>But I think that needs kind of the other
pieces to inform it,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/308-3
00:34:49.827 --> 00:34:53.433
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but that would be the things I think most
interesting at first.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/307-0
00:34:53.793 --> 00:34:54.193
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/309-0
00:34:59.833 --> 00:35:03.445
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I don't know, Sophie,
and you've seen all the person in site</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/309-1
00:35:03.445 --> 00:35:06.169
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>data.
Anything else you can think of that I'm</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/309-2
00:35:06.169 --> 00:35:07.353
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>not come out of RWD?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/310-0
00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:08.913
<v Bayed, Sofian>Um.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/313-0
00:35:13.193 --> 00:35:17.013
<v Miller, Jeremy>I'm thinking we may not have a good
answer to this question until there's</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/311-0
00:35:13.473 --> 00:35:13.553
<v Bayed, Sofian>Uh.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/313-1
00:35:17.013 --> 00:35:21.247
<v Miller, Jeremy>more definition around the definitions of
sites and relationships and things like</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/313-2
00:35:21.247 --> 00:35:24.964
<v Miller, Jeremy>that. But you know, it's really,
it's really, I mean, it's really easy.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/312-0
00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:22.513
<v Gohel, Suril>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/313-3
00:35:24.964 --> 00:35:28.629
<v Miller, Jeremy>It's relatively easy to aggregate a bunch
of data and show some stats.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/313-4
00:35:28.629 --> 00:35:29.713
<v Miller, Jeremy>The question is like.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/314-0
00:35:30.713 --> 00:35:34.333
<v Miller, Jeremy>Are we building?
If we're saying 2 providers are part of</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/314-1
00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:37.444
<v Miller, Jeremy>the same network or they have this
relationship,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/314-2
00:35:37.444 --> 00:35:40.873
<v Miller, Jeremy>are we doing it in a way that is
meaningful for what?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/315-0
00:35:41.753 --> 00:35:44.193
<v Miller, Jeremy>the use cases that our clients want to
use it for.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/317-0
00:35:46.313 --> 00:35:49.000
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK. I think I see what you're saying.
I think, yeah,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/317-1
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.650
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>then it's definitely volume of
interactions because I don't necessarily</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/317-2
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.235
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>care if they've only interacted a couple
of times.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/317-3
00:35:55.235 --> 00:35:58.733
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I care that they've have an ongoing
relationship more. And so to me,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/316-0
00:35:56.073 --> 00:35:56.913
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/317-4
00:35:58.733 --> 00:36:02.687
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>it's almost like a a range or a value,
right? If you have more relationships,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/317-5
00:36:02.687 --> 00:36:06.033
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>you get whatever ranked higher,
higher score, whatever if you're.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/318-0
00:36:06.073 --> 00:36:10.633
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Fewer relationships means looser
connection, lower score.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/319-0
00:36:11.593 --> 00:36:15.553
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I'm just, I'm just throwing stuff out.
I don't really know what it looks like.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/320-0
00:36:13.473 --> 00:36:16.775
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, no, that's OK. That's OK. Yeah,
this is all a proof of concept.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/320-1
00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:18.473
<v Miller, Jeremy>We're just trying to make trying to.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/322-0
00:36:19.433 --> 00:36:23.287
<v Miller, Jeremy>Come up with something that gives some
sort of sense of what we're going to look</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/321-0
00:36:20.353 --> 00:36:20.953
<v Gohel, Suril>Do.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/322-1
00:36:23.287 --> 00:36:23.953
<v Miller, Jeremy>at at the end.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/323-0
00:36:23.433 --> 00:36:24.873
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/326-0
00:36:24.873 --> 00:36:30.879
<v Gohel, Suril>So like from my, I come from Cigna, right?
And we always try to figure out which</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/326-1
00:36:30.879 --> 00:36:36.958
<v Gohel, Suril>providers were referring to which other
providers and that was one of the biggest</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/325-0
00:36:33.513 --> 00:36:33.953
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/326-2
00:36:36.958 --> 00:36:39.553
<v Gohel, Suril>problems to solve because referral.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/328-0
00:36:39.993 --> 00:36:43.981
<v Gohel, Suril>Was not something that was captured
accurately, right?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/328-1
00:36:43.981 --> 00:36:49.636
<v Gohel, Suril>I'm wondering if that's similar in RWD
notes here because I haven't looked at</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/327-0
00:36:44.113 --> 00:36:44.353
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/328-2
00:36:49.636 --> 00:36:53.913
<v Gohel, Suril>them because the the the workaround we
found was how many.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/329-0
00:36:55.033 --> 00:36:59.668
<v Gohel, Suril>Members were shared across providers,
so not a direct referral measure,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/329-1
00:36:59.668 --> 00:37:04.881
<v Gohel, Suril>but more of a measure as this member is
common between them in the last year and</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/329-2
00:37:04.881 --> 00:37:07.713
<v Gohel, Suril>that's why they are like connected
somehow.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/330-0
00:37:08.953 --> 00:37:12.456
<v Gohel, Suril>Is there actual patients itself? Yeah,
yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/331-0
00:37:09.073 --> 00:37:12.720
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>You mean the actual patient as a member?
OK, yeah. No, that's, yeah,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/330-1
00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:16.193
<v Gohel, Suril>So I'm trying to figure out if the refer,
yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/331-1
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.156
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>that makes sense to me.
I don't know what their data looks like.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/331-2
00:37:16.156 --> 00:37:19.803
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So I can't really, you know,
if that if that's an interesting metric</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/331-3
00:37:19.803 --> 00:37:23.028
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>too and and that's more reliable,
that would be interesting.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/331-4
00:37:23.028 --> 00:37:26.833
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I I don't know what they're. Yeah,
I'm not as familiar with their data.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/332-0
00:37:27.433 --> 00:37:31.284
<v Gohel, Suril>But with referrals,
do we think that our referral data is</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/332-1
00:37:31.284 --> 00:37:34.073
<v Gohel, Suril>very clean and good or we don't know that?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/333-0
00:37:33.993 --> 00:37:37.275
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I don't know. Yeah, I don't.
I don't have any access to that data.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/333-1
00:37:37.275 --> 00:37:40.753
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>So it's a good question. Totally agree.
Would love to know about that.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/335-0
00:37:38.393 --> 00:37:43.987
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah, there's two,
there are two. Well,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/335-1
00:37:43.987 --> 00:37:48.881
<v Miller, Jeremy>the first question is,
is that referral captured in EHR</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/334-0
00:37:47.033 --> 00:37:47.633
<v Gohel, Suril>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/335-2
00:37:48.881 --> 00:37:55.087
<v Miller, Jeremy>structured data? And if it's not,
it's definitely captured where it is</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/335-3
00:37:55.087 --> 00:37:55.873
<v Miller, Jeremy>recorded.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/336-0
00:37:56.313 --> 00:37:58.313
<v Miller, Jeremy>And note summaries.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/337-0
00:37:59.393 --> 00:38:03.873
<v Miller, Jeremy>So for example,
I'm just pulled up the viewer right here.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/339-0
00:38:02.793 --> 00:38:07.277
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Like the text. Yeah,
the the notes text is problematic. Agree.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/338-0
00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:05.353
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/339-1
00:38:07.277 --> 00:38:07.633
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/342-0
00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:13.180
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yes, we spent all we're working with it.
We spent a lot of time working with it</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/340-0
00:38:11.113 --> 00:38:12.033
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/342-1
00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:18.793
<v Miller, Jeremy>and and it's also obfuscated in many ways.
So where it says referral to psychology.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/341-0
00:38:14.193 --> 00:38:14.633
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yes.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/343-0
00:38:19.753 --> 00:38:22.872
<v Miller, Jeremy>We don't know who that is.
We don't know who that provider is.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/343-1
00:38:22.872 --> 00:38:26.683
<v Miller, Jeremy>The only way to guess about who that
provider is reasonable would be in that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/343-2
00:38:26.683 --> 00:38:29.703
<v Miller, Jeremy>patient's history,
who's the which is the next provider that</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/343-3
00:38:29.703 --> 00:38:31.633
<v Miller, Jeremy>they saw whose specialty is psychology.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/344-0
00:38:34.153 --> 00:38:37.524
<v Miller, Jeremy>Which doesn't mean that that's the person
they were referred to necessarily,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/344-1
00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:38.793
<v Miller, Jeremy>but it's a pretty good guess.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/348-0
00:38:38.953 --> 00:38:42.956
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah,
I I guess they could be also because you</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/345-0
00:38:39.353 --> 00:38:40.793
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yep, agree.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/348-1
00:38:42.956 --> 00:38:50.023
<v Bayed, Sofian>know, again, I'm not part of the RWD team,
so I my knowledge is very limited here,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/348-2
00:38:50.023 --> 00:38:55.729
<v Bayed, Sofian>but it seems like extracting that data
from text is quite complex,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/346-0
00:38:55.353 --> 00:38:55.873
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yes.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/348-3
00:38:55.729 --> 00:38:58.113
<v Bayed, Sofian>especially at scale I think.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/347-0
00:38:57.793 --> 00:38:57.953
<v Gohel, Suril>Yep.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/350-0
00:38:58.393 --> 00:39:05.272
<v Bayed, Sofian>I would probably consider proxies for
referrals. For example, a proxy.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/350-1
00:39:05.272 --> 00:39:10.794
<v Bayed, Sofian>Good proxy in my opinion could be you
take a patient ID,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/350-2
00:39:10.794 --> 00:39:13.313
<v Bayed, Sofian>you look at the different.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/352-0
00:39:13.513 --> 00:39:18.325
<v Bayed, Sofian>Persons, the different, you know,
medical experts,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/352-1
00:39:18.325 --> 00:39:26.157
<v Bayed, Sofian>that person visited in a short amount of
time and that's a likely referral, right?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/352-2
00:39:26.157 --> 00:39:33.233
<v Bayed, Sofian>So I don't know if I go to a doctor,
a generalist and two days after I go.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/351-0
00:39:27.913 --> 00:39:28.193
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/355-0
00:39:33.553 --> 00:39:39.358
<v Bayed, Sofian>I go to check, I don't know.
I have the words in French coming up,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/355-1
00:39:39.358 --> 00:39:45.249
<v Bayed, Sofian>but it's difficult to. Yeah,
but let's say if I go see a specialist</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/353-0
00:39:41.473 --> 00:39:44.673
<v Miller, Jeremy>Paid in French.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/355-2
00:39:45.249 --> 00:39:51.313
<v Bayed, Sofian>two days apart from my general
appointment, it's probably a referral,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/354-0
00:39:48.313 --> 00:39:48.753
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/355-3
00:39:51.313 --> 00:39:51.833
<v Bayed, Sofian>right?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/358-0
00:39:53.273 --> 00:40:01.869
<v Bayed, Sofian>So the timestamps of visits should be
quite informative or could be used as a</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/358-1
00:40:01.869 --> 00:40:04.073
<v Bayed, Sofian>proxy for referrals.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/356-0
00:40:02.513 --> 00:40:02.753
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/357-0
00:40:05.033 --> 00:40:05.153
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yes.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/359-0
00:40:18.753 --> 00:40:20.433
<v Gohel, Suril>What's the second point? Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/360-0
00:40:21.233 --> 00:40:21.433
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/361-0
00:40:25.713 --> 00:40:25.953
<v Miller, Jeremy>Right.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/363-0
00:40:26.033 --> 00:40:29.127
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Next visit,
because usually that would be you'd get</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/362-0
00:40:26.433 --> 00:40:26.553
<v Miller, Jeremy>Right.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/363-1
00:40:29.127 --> 00:40:33.767
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>the more generalist visit and then the
next visit after it is the specialist.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/363-2
00:40:33.767 --> 00:40:35.313
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>That might be interesting.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/364-0
00:40:37.593 --> 00:40:38.593
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I don't know.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/365-0
00:40:37.993 --> 00:40:40.953
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah, all right. And</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/366-0
00:40:39.593 --> 00:40:42.928
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, I mean,
it can get more complicated than that too.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/366-1
00:40:42.928 --> 00:40:47.316
<v Miller, Jeremy>Like, so let's say that I I go to my GP,
they refer me to a dermatologist.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/366-2
00:40:47.316 --> 00:40:50.242
<v Miller, Jeremy>I get appointment in six months.
In the meantime,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/366-3
00:40:50.242 --> 00:40:53.401
<v Miller, Jeremy>I go back to my GP and they refer me to a
podiatrist.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/366-4
00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:55.273
<v Miller, Jeremy>Podiatrist sees me the next day.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/367-0
00:40:55.673 --> 00:40:58.945
<v Miller, Jeremy>You know,
it's like I think that there has to be</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/367-1
00:40:58.945 --> 00:41:03.553
<v Miller, Jeremy>more than dates and NP is to figure out
kind of which goes to which.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/370-0
00:41:04.033 --> 00:41:08.979
<v Bayed, Sofian>Yeah, of course. I mean,
it's definitely not a perfect metric,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/370-1
00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:14.003
<v Bayed, Sofian>but if we have proxies,
I think at a very large scale you could</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/368-0
00:41:10.553 --> 00:41:10.753
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/370-2
00:41:14.003 --> 00:41:18.321
<v Bayed, Sofian>potentially have some trends here.
I I agree with you,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/369-0
00:41:16.873 --> 00:41:18.033
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, for sure.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/370-3
00:41:18.321 --> 00:41:20.833
<v Bayed, Sofian>it's it's it's not perfect data.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/372-0
00:41:21.593 --> 00:41:24.452
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Or like you said,
maybe layering in a couple of like,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/372-1
00:41:24.452 --> 00:41:27.787
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>that's one factor. But then also,
you know, anytime you see a,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/372-2
00:41:27.787 --> 00:41:30.275
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>like you said, Jeremy, a specialist,
you know,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/372-3
00:41:30.275 --> 00:41:34.033
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>and then the note says the same specialty,
maybe that's another piece.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/372-4
00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:37.633
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Maybe there's a few pieces here we need
to kind of string together.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/371-0
00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:37.153
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/375-0
00:41:38.153 --> 00:41:42.235
<v Miller, Jeremy>And the the referral can have like a
weight or a confidence score associated</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/375-1
00:41:42.235 --> 00:41:46.104
<v Miller, Jeremy>with it. It doesn't have to be binary.
So if we come up with some simple</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/374-0
00:41:43.633 --> 00:41:44.033
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/375-2
00:41:46.104 --> 00:41:48.966
<v Miller, Jeremy>heuristics for that,
then that can further inform the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/375-3
00:41:48.966 --> 00:41:53.153
<v Miller, Jeremy>probability that these two people are in
these two providers are in a network.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/376-0
00:41:53.993 --> 00:41:55.473
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Interesting.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/377-0
00:41:56.313 --> 00:42:01.878
<v Gohel, Suril>We have also seen that generally within a
referral generally happens within the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/377-1
00:42:01.878 --> 00:42:07.373
<v Gohel, Suril>same group of providers or same hospital
systems or same Yale of the provider.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/377-2
00:42:07.373 --> 00:42:12.033
<v Gohel, Suril>So like Yale would very unlikely refer to
someone outside of Yale.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/378-0
00:42:12.313 --> 00:42:16.073
<v Gohel, Suril>That's just how they were exactly.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/380-0
00:42:13.393 --> 00:42:17.084
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>But that's an interesting metric, right?
So that's the thing I don't want to,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/380-1
00:42:17.084 --> 00:42:20.255
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>but I don't want to hard.
I don't want to focus that way because I</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/380-2
00:42:20.255 --> 00:42:23.615
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>would be interested to see when they
don't refer within their network.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/380-3
00:42:23.615 --> 00:42:27.023
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>I think that's the other really
interesting thing to clients is to make</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/379-0
00:42:25.113 --> 00:42:25.393
<v Gohel, Suril>OK.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/380-4
00:42:27.023 --> 00:42:30.193
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>sure we capture that other piece too is
like when they go outside.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/381-0
00:42:30.793 --> 00:42:33.518
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>How often are they going outside?
Why are they going outside?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/381-1
00:42:33.518 --> 00:42:34.353
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>That type of thing?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/382-0
00:42:34.153 --> 00:42:34.993
<v Gohel, Suril>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/383-0
00:42:35.433 --> 00:42:36.753
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Yeah. Great. Cool. Thanks.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/384-0
00:42:39.073 --> 00:42:39.873
<v Bayed, Sofian>Persync.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/385-0
00:42:40.233 --> 00:42:45.517
<v Miller, Jeremy>All right, so Sophia and Surreal,
do you feel like you have enough</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/385-1
00:42:45.517 --> 00:42:48.593
<v Miller, Jeremy>information and context to get started?</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/386-0
00:42:49.753 --> 00:42:54.033
<v Gohel, Suril>Enough to be dangerous.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/389-0
00:42:51.833 --> 00:42:54.814
<v Miller, Jeremy>Enough to be dangerous.
That's all we want to know.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/389-1
00:42:54.814 --> 00:42:58.769
<v Miller, Jeremy>And I guess Sophia is really more is
playing a supportive role here,</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/389-2
00:42:58.769 --> 00:43:03.240
<v Miller, Jeremy>but I I imagine Sril's going to need some
help with access to fusion data and</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/390-0
00:43:02.073 --> 00:43:06.389
<v Bayed, Sofian>Definitely. Yeah,
I have a pretty good understanding of the</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/389-3
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.673
<v Miller, Jeremy>understanding what it is.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/387-0
00:43:03.673 --> 00:43:03.953
<v Gohel, Suril>Yes.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/388-0
00:43:05.113 --> 00:43:05.633
<v Gohel, Suril>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/390-1
00:43:06.389 --> 00:43:12.071
<v Bayed, Sofian>different tables that are used in fusion.
So if you have any questions or need</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/390-2
00:43:12.071 --> 00:43:17.033
<v Bayed, Sofian>access to different tables,
then let me know. I'll be happy to help.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/391-0
00:43:17.673 --> 00:43:19.553
<v Gohel, Suril>Sounds perfect. I'll set up some time.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/392-0
00:43:20.393 --> 00:43:20.833
<v Bayed, Sofian>Sounds good.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/394-0
00:43:20.553 --> 00:43:24.311
<v Gohel, Suril>And and just so that like I'm clear,
like we are still thinking looking at all</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/393-0
00:43:20.673 --> 00:43:20.713
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Oh.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/394-1
00:43:24.311 --> 00:43:28.070
<v Gohel, Suril>the structure data that we have and not
really going to focus on RWD notes and</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/394-2
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:31.923
<v Gohel, Suril>like trying to go through that like if if
we can do something with the structure</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/394-3
00:43:31.923 --> 00:43:33.873
<v Gohel, Suril>data that we have, that's our first pass.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/395-0
00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:39.036
<v Miller, Jeremy>I mean, I agree with that,
but I think I'm happy to leave that to</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/395-1
00:43:39.036 --> 00:43:39.793
<v Miller, Jeremy>your discretion.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/396-0
00:43:40.193 --> 00:43:41.233
<v Gohel, Suril>OK, that's fair.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/397-0
00:43:41.193 --> 00:43:41.833
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/398-0
00:43:46.393 --> 00:43:48.033
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Oh, thank you. Sounds good.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/399-0
00:43:47.953 --> 00:43:49.873
<v Gohel, Suril>Thank you. Thank you.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/400-0
00:43:48.233 --> 00:43:50.833
<v Miller, Jeremy>Cool. All right. Thanks everyone.
Thanks for your time.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/402-0
00:43:50.713 --> 00:43:53.993
<v Gessner, Gabrielle>Thanks. Talk to you later.
Have a good weekend.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/406-0
00:43:50.873 --> 00:43:54.193
<v Bayed, Sofian>Thank you so much. Have a good weekend.
Bye, bye.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/401-0
00:43:51.873 --> 00:43:52.473
<v Gohel, Suril>Thanks guys.</v>

75e2260b-a044-4821-8041-0be3fec83810/405-0
00:43:54.113 --> 00:43:54.633
<v Gohel, Suril>Thanks. Bye, guys.</v>

00:43:54.593 --> 00:43:54.993
<v Miller, Jeremy>Bye, bye.</v>
