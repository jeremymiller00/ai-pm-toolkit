00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:04.745
<v Perry, Allison>Like, let's say...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/9-0
00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:05.065
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/12-0
00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:08.858
<v Perry, Allison>Let's say that the, you know,
you're running,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/12-1
00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:11.315
<v Perry, Allison>let's say you have like chemotherapy,
right?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/12-2
00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:14.647
<v Perry, Allison>It could be the chemotherapy was noted on
January 1st, 2017,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/12-3
00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:18.634
<v Perry, Allison>but the note itself says patient started
chemotherapy, like Srinil said,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/12-4
00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:21.747
<v Perry, Allison>on January 1st, 2015.
I do think both of those dates are</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/12-5
00:00:21.747 --> 00:00:24.478
<v Perry, Allison>important.
I don't think that both of those dates</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/12-6
00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:26.225
<v Perry, Allison>should go to the client because.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/15-0
00:00:26.305 --> 00:00:30.258
<v Perry, Allison>a lot of times it creates a tonne of
confusion for the client. So downstream,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/11-0
00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:28.825
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/15-1
00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:34.313
<v Perry, Allison>I don't necessarily want to do that,
but I do think that it's important for us,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/15-2
00:00:34.313 --> 00:00:37.303
<v Perry, Allison>especially when we're reconciling and
tracing back, right?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/15-3
00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Perry, Allison>Or if we're looking at using that URL to
kind of trace back patients,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/13-0
00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:38.545
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/15-4
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.499
<v Perry, Allison>it is important for us to know what date
is on there and if there is a,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/15-5
00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.503
<v Perry, Allison>so like it sounds like these are all
dates that are on the note itself, right?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/15-6
00:00:48.503 --> 00:00:48.705
<v Perry, Allison>But.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/14-0
00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:49.145
<v Patel, Shrinal>Big.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/17-0
00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Perry, Allison>If another date is like,
let's say row 1054, open splenectomy,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/17-1
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.765
<v Perry, Allison>let's say that actually was an open
splenectomy that the doctor wrote about</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/17-2
00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:04.721
<v Perry, Allison>on January 5th, 2025, but it's history of.
And sometimes it won't say that when that</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/16-0
00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:02.985
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/17-3
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:08.995
<v Perry, Allison>was. And in that case,
the best date we have is January 5th,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/17-4
00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:09.345
<v Perry, Allison>2025.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/19-0
00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:13.572
<v Perry, Allison>Although there really should be something
in there that says its history of,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/19-1
00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Perry, Allison>because we want to differentiate that
from like a current active splenectomy.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/18-0
00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:16.425
<v Patel, Shrinal>Right.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/19-2
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.523
<v Perry, Allison>The other thing is,
if there is a date mentioned on there,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/19-3
00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:23.567
<v Perry, Allison>or even a month, year,
like I would be really interested in</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/19-4
00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:26.206
<v Perry, Allison>seeing what that was, because, and again,
that has,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/19-5
00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:28.945
<v Perry, Allison>that's a different concept than the date
on the note.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/22-0
00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:34.829
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, okay,
so I see some examples in here that are</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/20-0
00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:32.505
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yes, sir.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/22-1
00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.567
<v Miller, Jeremy>called,
that are status history that seem to</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/23-0
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:39.075
<v Perry, Allison>Oh, interesting. Exactly.
There's a star next to that date.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/21-0
00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:36.665
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/22-2
00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:38.905
<v Miller, Jeremy>represent. Yeah, yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/23-1
00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:40.225
<v Perry, Allison>What does that mean?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/29-0
00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:45.976
<v Miller, Jeremy>I'm going to assume from Jeff that that
means that that's,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/29-1
00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Miller, Jeremy>we're calling out that that's the Fed
date that then was mentioned in the note,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/29-2
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.498
<v Miller, Jeremy>not necessarily the date and all
likelihood,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/25-0
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:52.345
<v Patel, Shrinal>That.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/29-3
00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:58.011
<v Miller, Jeremy>not the date that was performed.
But we should have another field in here,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/26-0
00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:56.105
<v Patel, Shrinal>Okay.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/29-4
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Miller, Jeremy>I agree,
if we don't have it that says historical</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/27-0
00:01:58.185 --> 00:01:58.345
<v Patel, Shrinal>Mm.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/29-5
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.705
<v Miller, Jeremy>date or something like that.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/31-0
00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:05.676
<v Miller, Jeremy>or historical, some way of capturing.
Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/28-0
00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:07.145
<v Patel, Shrinal>Something, yeah, something to capture.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/31-1
00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Miller, Jeremy>And I'm sure sometimes that will be
specified and sometimes that it won't,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/31-2
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.360
<v Miller, Jeremy>right,
because the patient won't remember when</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/30-0
00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:15.665
<v Perry, Allison>There's plenty of time that's, oh yeah,
there's plenty of time that's not.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/31-3
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.745
<v Miller, Jeremy>it was or, yeah, yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/33-0
00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:16.425
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah,
most of the time I think we just use the</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/33-1
00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Patel, Shrinal>note date,
but it is good if we do have it because</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/33-2
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.784
<v Patel, Shrinal>then when we're talking to the client,
a lot of the note dates don't make sense</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/33-3
00:02:23.784 --> 00:02:27.716
<v Patel, Shrinal>to them, right? They're like, well,
you're telling me that the, like,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/32-0
00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:25.785
<v Miller, Jeremy>Right.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/33-4
00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:31.928
<v Patel, Shrinal>especially when it comes to like tumours
and metastasis, right? It's like,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/33-5
00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:34.905
<v Patel, Shrinal>you're telling me that it metastasized to
the liver.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/35-0
00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:39.079
<v Patel, Shrinal>but then we're looking at it and we're
seeing that it's already in the lung,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/35-1
00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.631
<v Patel, Shrinal>but how did,
like what time frame did that happen?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/35-2
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:45.785
<v Patel, Shrinal>And we're not being able to kind of give
them that story that they're looking for.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/34-0
00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:47.825
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/36-0
00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:50.545
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, that makes perfect sense.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/37-0
00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:52.793
<v Perry, Allison>Yeah,
and I think from a traceability</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/37-1
00:02:52.793 --> 00:02:55.065
<v Perry, Allison>standpoint that will help.
I don't even know. I don't know if...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/38-0
00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:53.625
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/41-0
00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:58.581
<v Perry, Allison>Like,
I'm fine with how it is in our current</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/41-1
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:01.309
<v Perry, Allison>NLP output, where one column is the, like,
you know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/41-2
00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:05.065
<v Perry, Allison>we have one field or column for the date
of the note and one column for.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/42-0
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.438
<v Perry, Allison>encounter event date if it happens to be
a different day. That's noted in the note.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/39-0
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:09.665
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/42-1
00:03:09.438 --> 00:03:11.645
<v Perry, Allison>So I'm fine with that,
but it sounds like Jeremy you had</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/42-2
00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:13.465
<v Perry, Allison>thoughts that this should be a separate
table.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/43-0
00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:19.426
<v Perry, Allison>Or did you, I think,
I think a little like a little bit ago</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/40-0
00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:18.585
<v Miller, Jeremy>Sorry, say that again.
You lost me at one point there.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/43-1
00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:23.532
<v Perry, Allison>when shrinal brought up this concept,
you would said maybe that the history</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/43-2
00:03:23.532 --> 00:03:27.961
<v Perry, Allison>should be in a separate table than this,
but are you are you still thinking that,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/45-0
00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:30.609
<v Miller, Jeremy>Oh, okay, yes. Well,
I was thinking of the way,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/43-3
00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:28.825
<v Perry, Allison>or do you think?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/45-1
00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.425
<v Miller, Jeremy>so what under the comment that Andres
made about,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/45-2
00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:37.311
<v Miller, Jeremy>so we build these tables in the summaries,
but inevitably there are,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/45-3
00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:41.085
<v Miller, Jeremy>let's call them stragglers.
There are there are there are facts or</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/44-0
00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:40.105
<v Perry, Allison>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/45-4
00:03:41.085 --> 00:03:45.309
<v Miller, Jeremy>information in the patient history that
don't neatly fit into one of these</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/45-5
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.505
<v Miller, Jeremy>categories, and one of them might be...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/46-0
00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:51.985
<v Miller, Jeremy>Patient broke their leg when they were
seven years old, or something like,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/46-1
00:03:51.985 --> 00:03:54.225
<v Miller, Jeremy>you know, some sort of bit of information.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/47-0
00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:59.683
<v Miller, Jeremy>So I think there needs to be a home.
Ideally, in the structured data,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/47-1
00:03:59.683 --> 00:04:04.636
<v Miller, Jeremy>there should be a home for these bits of
information that don't logically fit into</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/47-2
00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:07.740
<v Miller, Jeremy>diagnosis, treatment, procedures, la bala.
However,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/47-3
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.574
<v Miller, Jeremy>I agree with what you two have expressed
about where we can if historical events</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/47-4
00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:14.185
<v Miller, Jeremy>are mentioned in the notes.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/48-0
00:04:14.865 --> 00:04:18.268
<v Miller, Jeremy>that are not,
the event is not actually recorded</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/48-1
00:04:18.268 --> 00:04:22.295
<v Miller, Jeremy>anywhere in the notes. You know,
patient had a, you know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/48-2
00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:25.975
<v Miller, Jeremy>some surgery 20 years ago.
There should be some way.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/48-3
00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:31.113
<v Miller, Jeremy>I guess that's the question is,
do we list that in the procedure table or</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/48-4
00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:33.265
<v Miller, Jeremy>do we list that in some sort of</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/50-0
00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:37.788
<v Miller, Jeremy>inferred historical data type of table.
So although it comes down to the</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/50-1
00:04:37.788 --> 00:04:40.385
<v Miller, Jeremy>confidence that we have and that
information.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/49-0
00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:38.745
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/53-0
00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:46.663
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>I think too, I mean,
because we have been discussing that for</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/53-1
00:04:46.663 --> 00:04:49.273
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>our use cases.
So sometimes it's contractory,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/53-2
00:04:49.273 --> 00:04:52.961
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>the requirements, right? Like,
you could say, for example, like,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/53-3
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:56.252
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>a note today in October, like, oh,
I had a, I don't know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/52-0
00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:56.345
<v Perry, Allison>The second.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/53-4
00:04:56.252 --> 00:04:59.599
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>like a bladder surgery May last year.
And it's like, okay,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/53-5
00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.401
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>which note do you put? In some use cases,
they want to have, like,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/53-6
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:07.145
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>even if you mentioned that was in May,
the notice from today put.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/54-0
00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:08.665
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>Today, but...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/58-0
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:12.504
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>Semantically doesn't make sense.
Semantically,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/58-1
00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:16.607
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>or the meaning itself is in May.
So I think the best thing to do is for</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/58-2
00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:21.337
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>every event at least two dates. One date,
that is the date this is being extracted</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/58-3
00:05:21.337 --> 00:05:25.554
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>with links to the existing node,
and I don't know, like it's a tautology,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/58-4
00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:28.745
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>but the chronological node,
when this event took place.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/60-0
00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:33.381
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>So one date allows you to ascribe the
source note and the other date it's used</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/56-0
00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:29.665
<v Patel, Shrinal>Oh.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/57-0
00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:31.265
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/60-1
00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:36.651
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>for like logical analysis.
And it's not expanding the table,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/60-2
00:05:36.651 --> 00:05:39.653
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>it's just having two dates.
And when you only have one,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/60-3
00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:43.727
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>you just put the node date, right?
Because that's the anchor that you have.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/60-4
00:05:43.727 --> 00:05:47.587
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>You don't have anything else.
So I think that solves the two things and</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/60-5
00:05:47.587 --> 00:05:49.785
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>doesn't make you choose one or the other.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/61-0
00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:51.945
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>That's how we're thinking to address this.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/59-0
00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:51.305
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/62-0
00:05:52.465 --> 00:05:56.184
<v Miller, Jeremy>Except that there's historical stuff,
there will be times when the historical</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/62-1
00:05:56.184 --> 00:05:58.472
<v Miller, Jeremy>stuff,
the time information that you want to be</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/62-2
00:05:58.472 --> 00:06:00.665
<v Miller, Jeremy>captured cannot be captured by a single
date.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/63-0
00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:02.305
<v Patel, Shrinal>And.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/64-0
00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:05.728
<v Miller, Jeremy>I'm sure there will be.
So we need something a little more</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/64-1
00:06:05.728 --> 00:06:06.425
<v Miller, Jeremy>flexible there.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/65-0
00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:07.865
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/66-0
00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:14.385
<v Patel, Shrinal>And then I...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/67-0
00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Miller, Jeremy>For example,
patient was type 2 diabetic between 1990</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/67-1
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.905
<v Miller, Jeremy>and 1988 or something like that.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/68-0
00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:21.687
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>Oh,
that gets captured outside of the table</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/68-1
00:06:21.687 --> 00:06:23.465
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>in the bullet points that we keep.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/69-0
00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:28.305
<v Miller, Jeremy>Right, the things that need a home. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/70-0
00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:34.145
<v Miller, Jeremy>All right, I mean,
I think we can work through,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/70-1
00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:34.905
<v Miller, Jeremy>I think maybe...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/72-0
00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:40.074
<v Miller, Jeremy>So I'm getting a lot out of this
conversation.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/72-1
00:06:40.074 --> 00:06:43.898
<v Miller, Jeremy>I know we're short on time and you all
are very busy.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/72-2
00:06:43.898 --> 00:06:49.776
<v Miller, Jeremy>I think maybe a good way to work through,
so I think we've identified what are the</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/72-3
00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:54.945
<v Miller, Jeremy>core sort of gaps between what we produce
and what you see as, you know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/71-0
00:06:50.385 --> 00:06:50.865
<v Patel, Shrinal>Mhm.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/75-0
00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:58.774
<v Miller, Jeremy>a real source of value.
I think we could work through a lot of</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/75-1
00:06:58.774 --> 00:07:01.295
<v Miller, Jeremy>that in writing.
Like we can go back and forth,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/73-0
00:06:59.185 --> 00:06:59.665
<v Patel, Shrinal>Okay.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/75-2
00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:04.289
<v Miller, Jeremy>asynchronously, give an example,
define it and so forth.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/75-3
00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.072
<v Miller, Jeremy>I think the thing that's like the
critical question,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/75-4
00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:10.696
<v Miller, Jeremy>which I don't think we're going to answer
2 minutes here, of course,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/74-0
00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:09.185
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/75-5
00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:14.425
<v Miller, Jeremy>probably without ilan on the call either,
is like, what are the steps?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/78-0
00:07:14.665 --> 00:07:18.669
<v Miller, Jeremy>in this process. So,
and I can throw out what I think it looks</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/78-1
00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.164
<v Miller, Jeremy>like to me,
and we can come back to talk about it. So,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/78-2
00:07:22.164 --> 00:07:27.439
<v Miller, Jeremy>so we need to work through this feedback.
We need to get to a common understanding</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/78-3
00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:32.206
<v Miller, Jeremy>of these details about what we know,
what to whatever something like 9095%</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/78-4
00:07:32.206 --> 00:07:35.065
<v Miller, Jeremy>there.
I think the next the next two steps I</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/76-0
00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:33.265
<v Patel, Shrinal>Okay.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/77-0
00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:35.105
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/82-0
00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Miller, Jeremy>I see as one,
we need to do an evaluation similar to</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/82-1
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.525
<v Miller, Jeremy>the evaluation that we're talking about
for the structured,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/82-2
00:07:41.525 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Miller, Jeremy>other structured data feeds,
where we have some experts go through</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/82-3
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.048
<v Miller, Jeremy>these,
evaluate precision and recall correctness,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/79-0
00:07:45.985 --> 00:07:46.625
<v Patel, Shrinal>Because.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/82-4
00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:51.672
<v Miller, Jeremy>and come up with some baseline numbers,
just baselines, I think,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/80-0
00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:51.105
<v Patel, Shrinal>Mhm.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/82-5
00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:54.905
<v Miller, Jeremy>just kind of set the stage.
And then the second thing is.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/81-0
00:07:52.225 --> 00:07:52.305
<v Patel, Shrinal>The.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/83-0
00:07:55.345 --> 00:07:57.651
<v Miller, Jeremy>Can we do some customer discovery around
that,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/83-1
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:01.478
<v Miller, Jeremy>or do we already have some customer
discovery around this? Because, you know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/83-2
00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:05.059
<v Miller, Jeremy>our very sort of dumb way of thinking
about that question is like, look,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/83-3
00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:06.825
<v Miller, Jeremy>if we make this, will people buy it?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/84-0
00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:07.985
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/85-0
00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:10.985
<v Miller, Jeremy>And obviously there's nuance to that, but.
..</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/91-0
00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:18.547
<v Patel, Shrinal>No, I was going to say, yeah, I agree.
And I think, as you said,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/91-1
00:08:18.547 --> 00:08:23.072
<v Patel, Shrinal>with some of these things, I mean,
there's two additional things that come</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/86-0
00:08:22.345 --> 00:08:22.745
<v Miller, Jeremy>Sure.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/91-2
00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:26.149
<v Patel, Shrinal>to mind too.
So I can just type them and send them</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/91-3
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:30.011
<v Patel, Shrinal>over if that's helpful.
And this way we can start working at it</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/87-0
00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:27.145
<v Miller, Jeremy>Please do.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/91-4
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:32.967
<v Patel, Shrinal>because I think you guys do have like 90%
there.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/91-5
00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:36.225
<v Patel, Shrinal>It's just a few things that we've seen
along the way.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/89-0
00:08:33.865 --> 00:08:34.425
<v Perry, Allison>Sorry.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/93-0
00:08:36.505 --> 00:08:39.061
<v Patel, Shrinal>that might be helpful for you to add in
there.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/90-0
00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:37.225
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/93-1
00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:43.140
<v Patel, Shrinal>And then what you're talking about for
like the next steps and that, yeah,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/93-2
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.641
<v Patel, Shrinal>maybe on Wednesday when Elan's there as
well,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/93-3
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:49.665
<v Patel, Shrinal>we can get on the call and kind of see
what are the next steps from here.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/92-0
00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:50.025
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/96-0
00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.884
<v Miller, Jeremy>Just to recap quicker for you, Allison,
I was, you know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/94-0
00:08:53.305 --> 00:08:53.865
<v Perry, Allison>Yes.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/96-1
00:08:53.884 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Miller, Jeremy>let's close the gap between what we've
got and all of your great suggestions.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/96-2
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.991
<v Miller, Jeremy>I think we can do that asynchronously,
mostly in writing.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/95-0
00:09:00.345 --> 00:09:00.745
<v Perry, Allison>Okay.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/96-3
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:05.067
<v Miller, Jeremy>Let's do a simple evaluation of this,
like we talked about with the framework</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/96-4
00:09:05.067 --> 00:09:07.575
<v Miller, Jeremy>for the other feeds,
get some baseline metrics,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/96-5
00:09:07.575 --> 00:09:09.665
<v Miller, Jeremy>and then the other next step would be...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/99-0
00:09:09.785 --> 00:09:12.198
<v Miller, Jeremy>You know,
us understand customer discovery,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/99-1
00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:15.215
<v Miller, Jeremy>us understanding like, you know,
how saleable is this?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/99-2
00:09:15.215 --> 00:09:18.505
<v Miller, Jeremy>What is it going to take? You know,
should we keep pushing?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/97-0
00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:16.225
<v Patel, Shrinal>Thanks.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/98-0
00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:18.425
<v Patel, Shrinal>I.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/100-0
00:09:19.945 --> 00:09:23.796
<v Perry, Allison>Yeah, I mean, I think I think it's great.
I think I really agree with your point</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/100-1
00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:26.078
<v Perry, Allison>that like,
let's just get everything out of the</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/100-2
00:09:26.078 --> 00:09:28.313
<v Perry, Allison>notes.
We can figure out downstream from there</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/100-3
00:09:28.313 --> 00:09:31.165
<v Perry, Allison>how, how we want,
like what we want in terms of how we want</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/100-4
00:09:31.165 --> 00:09:31.545
<v Perry, Allison>to like.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/104-0
00:09:32.825 --> 00:09:35.712
<v Perry, Allison>use it downstream and filter,
but I think this is,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/104-1
00:09:35.712 --> 00:09:39.844
<v Perry, Allison>I personally think this is great.
I think the concept that you get a 360</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/104-2
00:09:39.844 --> 00:09:44.316
<v Perry, Allison>view into everything for that patient is
a huge differentiator between what we</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/102-0
00:09:41.025 --> 00:09:41.265
<v Patel, Shrinal>Okay.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/104-3
00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:44.825
<v Perry, Allison>have now.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/105-0
00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:46.745
<v Perry, Allison>Um...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/103-0
00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:46.745
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/106-0
00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:51.237
<v Perry, Allison>So I'm happy to do another round of
feedback once you have something that you</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/106-1
00:09:51.237 --> 00:09:51.705
<v Perry, Allison>want me to...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/109-0
00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:55.602
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah,
I'll work through the feedback you've</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/107-0
00:09:53.945 --> 00:09:54.745
<v Perry, Allison>Forgot to.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/109-1
00:09:55.602 --> 00:09:59.830
<v Miller, Jeremy>already provided. I'll create, you know,
make sure that it's clear so that folks</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/108-0
00:09:55.865 --> 00:09:56.425
<v Perry, Allison>Perfect.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/109-2
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.222
<v Miller, Jeremy>like Jeff and Andres can make changes.
Once we get through that,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/109-3
00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:06.876
<v Miller, Jeremy>we'll produce another round of output.
And if, and if it's, you know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/109-4
00:10:06.876 --> 00:10:09.172
<v Miller, Jeremy>if it looks good to you too,
then we'll do,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/109-5
00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:11.625
<v Miller, Jeremy>we'll plan an evaluation and get some
metrics.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/112-0
00:10:12.785 --> 00:10:15.148
<v Perry, Allison>Perfect. That sounds great. Yeah,
I would love that.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/112-1
00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:18.179
<v Perry, Allison>And then if we need to have another
meeting for this topic, we can.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/110-0
00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:16.705
<v Miller, Jeremy>Okay.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/112-2
00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:20.185
<v Perry, Allison>I know there's a few different work
streams.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/116-0
00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:22.786
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep, yes, so, so Alison, you know,
after this, right,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/111-0
00:10:20.505 --> 00:10:21.625
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, but let's.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/116-1
00:10:22.786 --> 00:10:25.466
<v Malik, Hassan>so the jeremy second point about customer
validation,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/116-2
00:10:25.466 --> 00:10:28.544
<v Malik, Hassan>I think we should not immediately,
but maybe after one round,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/116-3
00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:32.565
<v Malik, Hassan>let's start thinking about that, right?
I think ideally I would want to find one</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/113-0
00:10:31.545 --> 00:10:32.025
<v Perry, Allison>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/116-4
00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.295
<v Malik, Hassan>or two beta customers that we can partner
with, right,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/114-0
00:10:33.865 --> 00:10:34.345
<v Perry, Allison>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/116-5
00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:38.025
<v Malik, Hassan>and basically bring in some of their
actual use cases.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/117-0
00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:40.505
<v Malik, Hassan>and then use this feed to solve their
problems.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/115-0
00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:41.465
<v Perry, Allison>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/122-0
00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:45.696
<v Perry, Allison>And this, the thing is that,
so how are you, I know you have,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/122-1
00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:48.271
<v Perry, Allison>I know we're at the end of time,
but how would you,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/119-0
00:10:48.265 --> 00:10:48.425
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/122-2
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:51.539
<v Perry, Allison>how are you envisioning this working?
Like you're giving a three,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/122-3
00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:54.213
<v Perry, Allison>you're pulling a 360 view of everything
for patients.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/122-4
00:10:54.213 --> 00:10:58.175
<v Perry, Allison>When clients are working with us now,
the model under which we sell and licence</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/122-5
00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:01.988
<v Perry, Allison>data is very specific concepts or
entities that come out of it. For example,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/122-6
00:11:01.988 --> 00:11:05.305
<v Perry, Allison>it would, instead of being diagnoses,
it would be a diagnosis for.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/124-0
00:11:05.345 --> 00:11:09.814
<v Perry, Allison>IGAN, right? But here you're gonna pull,
let's say you have a top of the funnel.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/124-1
00:11:09.814 --> 00:11:14.338
<v Perry, Allison>Are you thinking that you'd pull like for
that specific top of the funnel cohort,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/124-2
00:11:14.338 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Perry, Allison>all of this data out for them?
Is that like one model we could work with?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/120-0
00:11:15.705 --> 00:11:16.185
<v Malik, Hassan>Yes.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/121-0
00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:22.345
<v Malik, Hassan>Yes, I mean that would be, yeah, yeah,
so that would be, you know.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/124-3
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.999
<v Perry, Allison>That's a, that's just interesting. I mean,
this would be so different than what we</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/124-4
00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:23.385
<v Perry, Allison>do now.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/123-0
00:11:23.785 --> 00:11:26.503
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep, but look,
it's going to be the most scalable</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/123-1
00:11:26.503 --> 00:11:29.547
<v Malik, Hassan>product in terms of sales in this area,
right? If, yes,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/123-2
00:11:29.547 --> 00:11:33.787
<v Malik, Hassan>because then we can just go and sell
literally and we process the whole thing</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/126-0
00:11:30.705 --> 00:11:32.185
<v Perry, Allison>Totally, totally.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/123-3
00:11:33.787 --> 00:11:37.864
<v Malik, Hassan>once and we can sell as many as we want
with no custom work needed, right?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/123-4
00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.745
<v Malik, Hassan>This can bring in substantial revenue
opportunities.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/127-0
00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:40.025
<v Perry, Allison>Totally.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/129-0
00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:47.024
<v Perry, Allison>What if we wanted to do something
depending on like the pricing where we</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/129-1
00:11:47.024 --> 00:11:51.625
<v Perry, Allison>did not push everything through?
Would that be really difficult to filter?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/125-0
00:11:47.545 --> 00:11:47.785
<v Patel, Shrinal>It.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/128-0
00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:50.745
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, yeah, so that...</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/133-0
00:11:52.505 --> 00:11:55.264
<v Malik, Hassan>Look, so there are,
there are two types of philtre philtres</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/133-1
00:11:55.264 --> 00:11:58.391
<v Malik, Hassan>possible, right? We can, so,
so one is of course cohort, right? So,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/133-2
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.886
<v Malik, Hassan>even though we will have everything
processed, we'll, you know, we'll sell,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/133-3
00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:04.875
<v Malik, Hassan>you know, disease by disease,
condition by condition, et cetera,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/131-0
00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:03.625
<v Perry, Allison>Mhm.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/132-0
00:12:04.025 --> 00:12:04.185
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/133-4
00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:08.277
<v Malik, Hassan>and then we, in terms of pricing,
we can have different types of packages</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/133-5
00:12:08.277 --> 00:12:10.439
<v Malik, Hassan>per se, right?
We can have some which are very</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/133-6
00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:14.025
<v Malik, Hassan>restrictive to certain number of fields,
certain type of information that is.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/135-0
00:12:14.305 --> 00:12:16.952
<v Malik, Hassan>you know, gold, plant, platinum, silver,
you know, whatever,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/135-1
00:12:16.952 --> 00:12:20.381
<v Malik, Hassan>however you guys want to define it, right?
So there could be one which is more</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/135-2
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:23.635
<v Malik, Hassan>expensive, that includes everything,
and there is some very cheap one with</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/135-3
00:12:23.635 --> 00:12:26.065
<v Malik, Hassan>extremely limited information and
something in between.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/134-0
00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:27.785
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/138-0
00:12:28.025 --> 00:12:30.241
<v Perry, Allison>Okay,
and then you have to think about how we'd</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/138-1
00:12:30.241 --> 00:12:33.612
<v Perry, Allison>price those differently. But yeah,
the first step is just seeing if they</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/136-0
00:12:31.065 --> 00:12:31.545
<v Malik, Hassan>yip.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/138-2
00:12:33.612 --> 00:12:36.474
<v Perry, Allison>work, because I agree,
those are two very different concepts.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/137-0
00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:36.825
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/138-3
00:12:36.474 --> 00:12:37.305
<v Perry, Allison>Super interesting.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/143-0
00:12:37.985 --> 00:12:40.750
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep, and, and look,
the other use of course, yeah,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/139-0
00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:41.785
<v Perry, Allison>I want to pilot one of each. Yes, sorry,
go ahead.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/143-1
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.273
<v Malik, Hassan>the other use of it is essentially
helping accelerate, you know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/140-0
00:12:42.505 --> 00:12:42.545
<v Miller, Jeremy>I.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/141-0
00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:43.985
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yes.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/143-2
00:12:44.273 --> 00:12:48.446
<v Malik, Hassan>these custom projects as well, right?
But that's a separate use because now,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/143-3
00:12:48.446 --> 00:12:51.915
<v Malik, Hassan>instead of even summary,
this output can become the input for a</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/142-0
00:12:49.265 --> 00:12:49.545
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/143-4
00:12:51.915 --> 00:12:55.384
<v Malik, Hassan>lot of that work, right?
This output plus the structured output</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/143-5
00:12:55.384 --> 00:12:58.636
<v Malik, Hassan>that we already have,
structured data that we already have,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/143-6
00:12:58.636 --> 00:12:59.665
<v Malik, Hassan>we just write code.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/146-0
00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:03.153
<v Malik, Hassan>You know, you know,
post-process this stuff and make it more</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/146-1
00:13:03.153 --> 00:13:05.992
<v Malik, Hassan>specialized, right,
for a given customer project. So,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/144-0
00:13:04.345 --> 00:13:04.665
<v Miller, Jeremy>Just.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/146-2
00:13:05.992 --> 00:13:09.778
<v Malik, Hassan>so that's a given pretty much,
and I would want to find at least one or</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/146-3
00:13:09.778 --> 00:13:13.406
<v Malik, Hassan>two use cases from the existing backlog
where we use that, you know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/146-4
00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Malik, Hassan>output as input and essentially deliver
them and measure ourselves in terms of</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/145-0
00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:16.505
<v Perry, Allison>Mhm.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/146-5
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.345
<v Malik, Hassan>quality and time and everything else,
right? So, we should do that too.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/147-0
00:13:21.465 --> 00:13:25.344
<v Malik, Hassan>I think that's there is value right there,
but I, but I'm equally interested,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/147-1
00:13:25.344 --> 00:13:29.421
<v Malik, Hassan>if not more, in coming up with a general,
you know, sellable feed with, you know,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/147-2
00:13:29.421 --> 00:13:31.658
<v Malik, Hassan>tiered pricing model and so on and so
forth,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/147-3
00:13:31.658 --> 00:13:35.040
<v Malik, Hassan>because that's that's what it scales,
right? That requires nothing,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/147-4
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.785
<v Malik, Hassan>no custom work.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/148-0
00:13:36.705 --> 00:13:41.228
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>And it also allows you, I mean,
the main vision at the beginning was like,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/148-1
00:13:41.228 --> 00:13:43.701
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>yeah,
working with notes is hard because</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/148-2
00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>they're massive, right?
But this summaries give you, let's say,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/148-3
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.515
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>10 to 20 times compression.
So it's way smaller.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/148-4
00:13:50.515 --> 00:13:55.158
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>And then perhaps someone wants like a
very specific line of therapy analysis</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/148-5
00:13:55.158 --> 00:13:56.545
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>with an index diagnose.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/156-0
00:13:56.665 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>then you reprocess,
but you don't reprocess the notes,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/156-1
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.936
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>you reprocess the summaries,
which is way faster.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/149-0
00:14:00.025 --> 00:14:01.465
<v Perry, Allison>Yes, yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/151-0
00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.385
<v Perry, Allison>And cheaper, right?</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/150-0
00:14:02.665 --> 00:14:02.905
<v Patel, Shrinal>Thank you.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/156-2
00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:07.654
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>And you can deliver a project too, yeah.
And the LLM is smart enough that even</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/153-0
00:14:05.305 --> 00:14:05.465
<v Patel, Shrinal>Yeah.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/156-3
00:14:07.654 --> 00:14:11.058
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>though it's not in the summary explicitly
a fishery one,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/156-4
00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:15.716
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>with that context builds the analysis
downstream. And yeah, makes it cheaper,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/154-0
00:14:14.025 --> 00:14:14.665
<v Perry, Allison>Mhm.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/155-0
00:14:14.665 --> 00:14:14.825
<v Patel, Shrinal>You.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/156-5
00:14:15.716 --> 00:14:18.105
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>faster, and scales quite nicely. Because</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/157-0
00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:21.245
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>If a client pays for one and you're
summarising those patients,</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/157-1
00:14:21.245 --> 00:14:24.505
<v Aldana, Andr&#233;s>those summaries are billed for the next
plan that asks for another thing.</v>

d6ff6289-065c-41ec-83bb-f4d8918b9e64/159-0
00:14:27.465 --> 00:14:31.188
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, yeah, not just summaries, right?
