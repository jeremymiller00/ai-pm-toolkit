00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:09.068
<v Miller, Jeremy>All right.
So thanks for making some time to circle</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/8-1
00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:13.431
<v Miller, Jeremy>back on this initiative.
I've had a little bit of time to review</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/8-2
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:18.935
<v Miller, Jeremy>and think about the information that was
presented and do some research and think</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/8-3
00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.218
<v Miller, Jeremy>about how we might structure this.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/10-0
00:00:21.258 --> 00:00:27.278
<v Miller, Jeremy>In terms of, you know,
putting together a robot that makes sense.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/10-1
00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:28.738
<v Miller, Jeremy>So let me share.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/11-0
00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Miller, Jeremy>All right, so and at any point,
if there's any questions or corrections</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/11-1
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.141
<v Miller, Jeremy>or things that need to be added,
please jump in.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/11-2
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.178
<v Miller, Jeremy>You don't have to wait till the end.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/12-0
00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:51.091
<v Miller, Jeremy>But I believe this is our mission,
which is to turn Skipta as it stands</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/12-1
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:56.236
<v Miller, Jeremy>today into an integrated AI powered
optimization platform using Norstella's</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/12-2
00:00:56.236 --> 00:01:00.771
<v Miller, Jeremy>proprietary RWD to deliver unmatched
engagement and drive revenue.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/12-3
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:03.818
<v Miller, Jeremy>So two key points being there being the
RWD.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/13-0
00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:07.779
<v Miller, Jeremy>Integration, you know,
we have data that other folks don't have.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/13-1
00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:11.197
<v Miller, Jeremy>We have the engagement data from Skipta,
we have the access,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/13-2
00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:15.735
<v Miller, Jeremy>we know a lot about the physicians and
then also the opportunity to build a more</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/13-3
00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:20.217
<v Miller, Jeremy>integrated platform that just creates
less steps overall and helps us capture a</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/13-4
00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:21.058
<v Miller, Jeremy>bit more value.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/14-0
00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:30.886
<v Miller, Jeremy>So I think this is really the key slide
and we can spend some time here thinking</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/14-1
00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:35.669
<v Miller, Jeremy>about how this might look for a build out.
There are three work streams.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/14-2
00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:40.978
<v Miller, Jeremy>The first one is is RJBD powered insights.
So that's that quick win work stream.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/15-0
00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:46.141
<v Miller, Jeremy>Where we take campaigns,
we match skip to data to RBD data,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/15-1
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:52.755
<v Miller, Jeremy>we build those profiles for providers and
we build a a model that that is a you can</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/15-2
00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:56.298
<v Miller, Jeremy>call it a look alike or a matching model
so.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/16-0
00:01:56.498 --> 00:01:59.416
<v Miller, Jeremy>You know, the key,
one of the key value props there is</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/16-1
00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:02.811
<v Miller, Jeremy>you've got a campaign,
you've had engagement from this segment,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/16-2
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:05.571
<v Miller, Jeremy>you know,
do the analysis to figure out who engaged</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/16-3
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:08.489
<v Miller, Jeremy>and who didn't,
and then find those people who engaged</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/16-4
00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.938
<v Miller, Jeremy>who weren't necessarily part of the
campaign and add them to it.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/17-0
00:02:12.138 --> 00:02:16.183
<v Miller, Jeremy>As well as other learnings,
but I think that's a key value prop.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/17-1
00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:19.419
<v Miller, Jeremy>The second work stream is the reporting
automation.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/17-2
00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:23.776
<v Miller, Jeremy>How can we define and build standardized
metrics, processes, outputs,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/17-3
00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:28.319
<v Miller, Jeremy>documents to speed that up while
retaining the high level of quality and</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/17-4
00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.938
<v Miller, Jeremy>oversight that we deliver?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/18-0
00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:34.042
<v Miller, Jeremy>And then the third is the integrated
platform workstream,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/18-1
00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:38.023
<v Miller, Jeremy>which I think is the biggest of the three,
which is, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/18-2
00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:42.824
<v Miller, Jeremy>how do we leverage our data to really
optimize campaigns while creating a a</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/18-3
00:02:42.824 --> 00:02:47.058
<v Miller, Jeremy>single place that that our clients can
come to and have access to?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/19-0
00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:51.416
<v Miller, Jeremy>You know, a fuller pipeline.
So I've broken it down into, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/19-1
00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:55.707
<v Miller, Jeremy>high-level outcomes across four quarters
across each work stream, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/19-2
00:02:55.707 --> 00:03:00.054
<v Miller, Jeremy>starting with the most of the effort
initially to get that quick win out the</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/19-3
00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:02.538
<v Miller, Jeremy>door,
which is those RGWD powered insights.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/20-0
00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:07.682
<v Miller, Jeremy>Finding those missing people and really
understanding how campaigns are</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/20-1
00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:11.663
<v Miller, Jeremy>performing and joining that data.
And while we're doing that,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/20-2
00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:16.288
<v Miller, Jeremy>we'll be doing research and evaluation
about the metrics and reporting,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/20-3
00:03:16.288 --> 00:03:19.178
<v Miller, Jeremy>building standardized metrics,
dictionaries.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/21-0
00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:23.013
<v Miller, Jeremy>Building basic, you know,
infrastructure for that as well as on the</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/21-1
00:03:23.013 --> 00:03:25.443
<v Miller, Jeremy>third work stream,
doing research analysis,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/21-2
00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:28.922
<v Miller, Jeremy>probably a lot of this you already have,
but communicating it,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/21-3
00:03:28.922 --> 00:03:33.230
<v Miller, Jeremy>making it a relevant for this particular
project and then starting basic data</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/21-4
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.544
<v Miller, Jeremy>pipeline architecture.
So we come out of Q1 on workstream 3</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/21-5
00:03:36.544 --> 00:03:38.698
<v Miller, Jeremy>having a really solid plan and then we.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/22-0
00:03:38.778 --> 00:03:43.857
<v Miller, Jeremy>Gradually shift effort away from
workstream one towards two and three</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/22-1
00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:47.776
<v Miller, Jeremy>quarter two.
We build more advanced lookalike models,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/22-2
00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:51.476
<v Miller, Jeremy>add more features,
hopefully add improved metrics.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/22-3
00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:57.354
<v Miller, Jeremy>We start to automate reporting as much as
possible for standardized things or at</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/22-4
00:03:57.354 --> 00:03:58.298
<v Miller, Jeremy>least get to.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/23-0
00:03:58.298 --> 00:04:03.228
<v Miller, Jeremy>You know something like a 50% state of
automation for for more coms select</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/23-1
00:04:03.228 --> 00:04:08.421
<v Miller, Jeremy>things and then we start to build you
know for that third pipeline will in all</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/23-2
00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:13.023
<v Miller, Jeremy>likelihood that DSP integration,
advanced targeting and kind of basic</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/23-3
00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:14.338
<v Miller, Jeremy>optimization engine.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/24-0
00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:17.839
<v Miller, Jeremy>And then as we get into the second-half
of the year,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/24-1
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.001
<v Miller, Jeremy>it really shifts more towards that
platform tweaks and fine tuning on the</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/24-2
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:24.701
<v Miller, Jeremy>first workstream where needed for
workstream 2,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/24-3
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:29.258
<v Miller, Jeremy>the reporting really aiming for a high
automation rate with minimal oversight so</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/24-4
00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:32.858
<v Miller, Jeremy>that we can scale without necessarily
adding time or headcount.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/25-0
00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:37.661
<v Miller, Jeremy>And having a first version of that
integrated platform and looking at</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/25-1
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:42.380
<v Miller, Jeremy>internally, making sure it works,
maybe some EA users helping us identify,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/25-2
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.035
<v Miller, Jeremy>refine it. And then as we get into Q4,
it really the effort really shifts</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/25-3
00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:51.754
<v Miller, Jeremy>towards to making that platform do
everything we want it to do and I and I</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/25-4
00:04:51.754 --> 00:04:52.698
<v Miller, Jeremy>have some more.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/26-0
00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:55.814
<v Miller, Jeremy>Detailed slides about what I think that
looks like.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/26-1
00:04:55.814 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Miller, Jeremy>The first two are are really clear to me.
I I think I pretty understand really well</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/26-2
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.276
<v Miller, Jeremy>what what that looks like,
what it would mean and what kind of would</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/26-3
00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:07.539
<v Miller, Jeremy>need to be built.
The third one is a little bit less clear</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/26-4
00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.194
<v Miller, Jeremy>to me,
but I think I get the basics and I think</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/26-5
00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:10.858
<v Miller, Jeremy>I just need.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/27-0
00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:14.947
<v Miller, Jeremy>We just need to share more information
and communicate more about exactly how</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/27-1
00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:18.565
<v Miller, Jeremy>things are working now and how the data
are flowing in work streams.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/27-2
00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:22.655
<v Miller, Jeremy>But that's all work that can be done for
sure. And then some key assumptions.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/27-3
00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:25.329
<v Miller, Jeremy>You know,
this is a substantial body of work which</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/27-4
00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:26.378
<v Miller, Jeremy>is going to involve.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/28-0
00:05:26.698 --> 00:05:31.428
<v Miller, Jeremy>Data science, but not just data science.
So we would need some data engineering</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/28-1
00:05:31.428 --> 00:05:36.454
<v Miller, Jeremy>folks to help us build and maintain those
pipelines, connecting the pieces together.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/28-2
00:05:36.454 --> 00:05:41.125
<v Miller, Jeremy>We would obviously need some front end
engineers to to build the the marketing</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/28-3
00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:41.658
<v Miller, Jeremy>platform.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/29-0
00:05:41.978 --> 00:05:45.894
<v Miller, Jeremy>Which we would, you know,
those 3 engineering squads would have to</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/29-1
00:05:45.894 --> 00:05:50.277
<v Miller, Jeremy>coordinate very closely and then some
sort of platform UX or UI design for</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/29-2
00:05:50.277 --> 00:05:54.369
<v Miller, Jeremy>really making sure it works for the
clients that are going to use it.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/29-3
00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:57.818
<v Miller, Jeremy>So I'll pause here for any thoughts,
feedbacks, questions.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/30-0
00:06:00.778 --> 00:06:06.309
<v Marshall, Jake>Jeremy, thanks for putting this together.
I do. I do want to just just call out.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/30-1
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:11.021
<v Marshall, Jake>I'm just not sure if this was factored
into your your thinking here,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/30-2
00:06:11.021 --> 00:06:14.778
<v Marshall, Jake>but we are we do have a separate work
stream going on.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/32-0
00:06:16.378 --> 00:06:21.918
<v Marshall, Jake>A data cloud project that's going to
enable our next next best action delivery.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/32-1
00:06:21.918 --> 00:06:27.251
<v Marshall, Jake>So we are essentially already putting the
infrastructure in place. You know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/32-2
00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:30.368
<v Marshall, Jake>it's not necessarily the decisioning
engine,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/32-3
00:06:30.368 --> 00:06:34.178
<v Marshall, Jake>but the logic could potentially be be
built into that.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/33-0
00:06:34.818 --> 00:06:40.956
<v Marshall, Jake>So you know there is there is you know
those these things would have to you know</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/33-1
00:06:40.956 --> 00:06:47.018
<v Marshall, Jake>talk to one another but there's you know
there's a you know acquiring that data</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/33-2
00:06:47.018 --> 00:06:51.338
<v Marshall, Jake>cloud piece from Salesforce and then
having that be the.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/34-0
00:06:51.818 --> 00:06:57.826
<v Marshall, Jake>You know where we manage our our
customers and you know create the the</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/34-1
00:06:57.826 --> 00:07:04.258
<v Marshall, Jake>more you know the the setups to to
generate execution list by by channel is</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/34-2
00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:10.098
<v Marshall, Jake>at least theorized now to kind of all all
live off of of data cloud.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/35-0
00:07:10.938 --> 00:07:14.387
<v Marshall, Jake>So I mean,
this could just be like another another</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/35-1
00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:18.784
<v Marshall, Jake>piece that that plugs into that, you know,
in in some way. Andy,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/35-2
00:07:18.784 --> 00:07:22.978
<v Marshall, Jake>am I thinking about that the right way
from your perspective?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/37-0
00:07:28.338 --> 00:07:34.039
<v Popp, Andrew>Yeah, I think so,
but I'm not sure where the are you</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/37-1
00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:42.538
<v Popp, Andrew>talking about for like developing like
the the lookalike model to do the next.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/41-0
00:07:41.018 --> 00:07:43.914
<v Marshall, Jake>No, no,
more for like the next best action engine</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/38-0
00:07:43.418 --> 00:07:44.418
<v Popp, Andrew>Q3 OK.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/41-1
00:07:43.914 --> 00:07:46.579
<v Marshall, Jake>part. I see that and say, hey,
we've already,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/41-2
00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:50.867
<v Marshall, Jake>we're kind of building that already.
Now you know the level of we haven't</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/39-0
00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:47.698
<v Popp, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/41-3
00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:55.270
<v Marshall, Jake>gotten to the point where we actually are
truly building the engine, right?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/40-0
00:07:51.218 --> 00:07:51.378
<v Popp, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/41-4
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.298
<v Marshall, Jake>We're just building the automation.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/43-0
00:07:57.738 --> 00:08:02.028
<v Marshall, Jake>To provide for like the decisioning.
So it just seems like you know the these</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/42-0
00:08:01.538 --> 00:08:01.778
<v Popp, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/43-1
00:08:02.028 --> 00:08:06.538
<v Marshall, Jake>projects will have to kind of be in tune
with each other and I don't I don't want</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/43-2
00:08:06.538 --> 00:08:10.828
<v Marshall, Jake>to you know waste waste motion by by
duplicating efforts if if it's something</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/43-3
00:08:10.828 --> 00:08:14.018
<v Marshall, Jake>that we're already accounting for with
with that project.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/45-0
00:08:14.738 --> 00:08:18.722
<v Skokos, Spiro>Yeah, good point, Jake. Yeah,
that definitely side by side.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/44-0
00:08:15.098 --> 00:08:16.258
<v Popp, Andrew>Yeah, so.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/45-1
00:08:18.722 --> 00:08:23.105
<v Skokos, Spiro>Just keep that in mind.
Like Jake said that that development will</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/45-2
00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:25.098
<v Skokos, Spiro>be happening parallel I guess.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/46-0
00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:30.654
<v Popp, Andrew>Yeah.
So I guess the question Jeremy is the so</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/46-1
00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:36.618
<v Popp, Andrew>the work stream one for Q3,
so predictive lift modeling,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/46-2
00:08:36.618 --> 00:08:40.698
<v Popp, Andrew>so predictive lift modeling being lift.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/48-0
00:08:41.178 --> 00:08:45.551
<v Popp, Andrew>To HC PS that we're currently not
targeting.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/48-1
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:51.673
<v Popp, Andrew>And then is there a predictive model for
Nest Next Nest? Geez,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/48-2
00:08:51.673 --> 00:08:56.338
<v Popp, Andrew>easy for me to say next best action as
well or?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/49-0
00:08:57.818 --> 00:09:02.818
<v Skokos, Spiro>Yeah,
maybe they split WS1 into 1A and 1B or.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/52-0
00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:05.299
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, yeah,
that's that's kind of what I was</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/52-1
00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:09.165
<v Miller, Jeremy>initially thinking.
But of course it's very open to, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/50-0
00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:09.058
<v Popp, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/52-2
00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:14.197
<v Miller, Jeremy>doing what makes sense. I mean, you know,
why would modular modularize as much as</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/52-3
00:09:14.197 --> 00:09:17.878
<v Miller, Jeremy>practical, right?
So if if we want to predict lift in terms</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/51-0
00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:15.778
<v Popp, Andrew>Right.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/52-4
00:09:17.878 --> 00:09:18.738
<v Miller, Jeremy>of engagement.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/53-0
00:09:19.178 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Miller, Jeremy>Or anything else like that should be a
standalone thing that data science builds,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/53-1
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.690
<v Miller, Jeremy>which then integrates with this platform
or can be called independently,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/53-2
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.698
<v Miller, Jeremy>could be integrated into Salesforce or
wherever.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/54-0
00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:35.560
<v Popp, Andrew>Yeah, it's interesting from being able to,
you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/54-1
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.480
<v Popp, Andrew>predict what a next best action would be
currently. And Jake, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/54-2
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.897
<v Popp, Andrew>jump in and correct me if I'm wrong,
we get told,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/54-3
00:09:43.897 --> 00:09:48.818
<v Popp, Andrew>you know what the kind of the journey is
going to be. So what the next.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/55-0
00:09:49.098 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Popp, Andrew>Action is going to be based on, you know,
engagement of a starting kind of tactic.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/55-1
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.738
<v Popp, Andrew>So I don't know if that would be, Jake,
something that we can.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/57-0
00:10:03.778 --> 00:10:06.862
<v Marshall, Jake>Most of the time,
I mean it's it kind of happens in in</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/56-0
00:10:05.498 --> 00:10:05.818
<v Popp, Andrew>And.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/57-1
00:10:06.862 --> 00:10:10.787
<v Marshall, Jake>various flavors, Jeremy and team.
So like most of the time as of now,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/57-2
00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:14.208
<v Marshall, Jake>clients are very prescriptive with us in
terms of, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/57-3
00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:18.358
<v Marshall, Jake>here's the CP years and here's,
here's what we want them to do and here's</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/57-4
00:10:18.358 --> 00:10:20.938
<v Marshall, Jake>what we want them to do after that,
you know?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/59-0
00:10:21.698 --> 00:10:25.009
<v Marshall, Jake>Less commonly, we have the opportunity to,
you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/59-1
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:29.445
<v Marshall, Jake>suggest what those journeys would be.
And to date, right, they're not,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/59-2
00:10:29.445 --> 00:10:34.381
<v Marshall, Jake>they're not based on performance data.
They're based on some logic and saying,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/59-3
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:38.818
<v Marshall, Jake>hey, if we get someone to point A,
let's then get them to point B and.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/60-0
00:10:39.098 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Marshall, Jake>You know,
having them see another custom message is</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/60-1
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.099
<v Marshall, Jake>is better than seeing the 1st.
So there's definitely an opportunity to</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/60-2
00:10:47.099 --> 00:10:52.303
<v Marshall, Jake>leverage data to potentially, you know,
allow us to be more prescriptive and in</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/60-3
00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:57.378
<v Marshall, Jake>setting up those journeys on our own when
we have the opportunities to do so.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/62-0
00:10:57.378 --> 00:11:01.552
<v Marshall, Jake>Jim, I would just say like I I don't,
I don't want to throw cold water on on on</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/62-1
00:11:01.552 --> 00:11:04.109
<v Marshall, Jake>these ideas because I think you know if
if this,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/62-2
00:11:04.109 --> 00:11:08.440
<v Marshall, Jake>if this conversation's about you know how
do we get skipped it to 100 million then</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/62-3
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.144
<v Marshall, Jake>obviously we've got to have some big
ideas like this and and make some</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/61-0
00:11:10.138 --> 00:11:10.458
<v Popp, Andrew>Done.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/62-4
00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:13.658
<v Marshall, Jake>advances on what we're doing.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/63-0
00:11:13.858 --> 00:11:19.089
<v Marshall, Jake>I will just say though that you know the
scale of what we execute and and the</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/63-1
00:11:19.089 --> 00:11:23.918
<v Marshall, Jake>types of tactics we execute aren't
necessarily conducive to performance</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/63-2
00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:28.076
<v Marshall, Jake>based optimization.
So what I mean by that is you know if I'm</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/63-3
00:11:28.076 --> 00:11:29.418
<v Marshall, Jake>delivering you know.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/64-0
00:11:30.538 --> 00:11:35.407
<v Marshall, Jake>200 views of something in a month and the
only thing that people did with it is</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/64-1
00:11:35.407 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Marshall, Jake>view it. You know,
am I really going to be able to generate,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/64-2
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.164
<v Marshall, Jake>you know,
segments built on on performance and to</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/64-3
00:11:42.164 --> 00:11:45.938
<v Marshall, Jake>say that is like this isn't, you know,
it isn't banner media.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/64-4
00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:50.138
<v Marshall, Jake>I mean there we do have banner media,
but and we do have some of it.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/65-0
00:11:50.338 --> 00:11:54.682
<v Marshall, Jake>That scale when we leverage it off site,
but we don't have, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/65-1
00:11:54.682 --> 00:11:59.586
<v Marshall, Jake>tonnage of banner impressions to make
informed decisions based off things like</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/65-2
00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:04.117
<v Marshall, Jake>click rates like you really would
probably want to do to make this thing</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/65-3
00:12:04.117 --> 00:12:07.779
<v Marshall, Jake>really, really work.
So just just food for thought like it</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/65-4
00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:08.338
<v Marshall, Jake>might be.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/66-0
00:12:08.818 --> 00:12:14.060
<v Marshall, Jake>You know, time spent with a tactic,
it just it just might have to be kind of</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/66-1
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Marshall, Jake>other things than what might be, you know,
traditionally thought about as you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/66-2
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.138
<v Marshall, Jake>a a signal for optimization with like
this type of an approach.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/67-0
00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:29.509
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yeah, that. I mean,
that makes perfect sense. And you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/67-1
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:33.055
<v Miller, Jeremy>where we would,
where we had the opportunity to do that,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/67-2
00:12:33.055 --> 00:12:37.098
<v Miller, Jeremy>we could and where we don't, we wouldn't,
obviously. Yeah, yeah.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/68-0
00:12:35.218 --> 00:12:38.790
<v Marshall, Jake>Yep. OK, cool.
And I would say the other I mean just</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/68-1
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:44.182
<v Marshall, Jake>practically the the the profiling and
look alike opportunities you know may may</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/68-2
00:12:44.182 --> 00:12:49.575
<v Marshall, Jake>need to be more about and this is what
we're already doing anyway we just don't</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/68-3
00:12:49.575 --> 00:12:54.698
<v Marshall, Jake>have an an automated platform to do it.
But you know you gave us a list of.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/69-0
00:12:54.898 --> 00:12:58.550
<v Marshall, Jake>Target list HC PS,
we're going to give you back, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/69-1
00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.882
<v Marshall, Jake>suggested additional HC PS based on their
patient treatment behavior,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/69-2
00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:06.844
<v Marshall, Jake>prescribing behavior,
lab behavior or whatever else we're we're</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/69-3
00:13:06.844 --> 00:13:09.815
<v Marshall, Jake>leveraging our RWD for.
So it's it's it's more,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/69-4
00:13:09.815 --> 00:13:14.458
<v Marshall, Jake>it's much more common for us right to
make those recommendations based on.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/70-0
00:13:14.578 --> 00:13:17.693
<v Marshall, Jake>You know,
a matching or you know a profile built</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/70-1
00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:22.715
<v Marshall, Jake>off of the initial target list because if
we know you know who the clients are</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/70-2
00:13:22.715 --> 00:13:26.212
<v Marshall, Jake>trying to reach,
then obviously we have other ways to,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/70-3
00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:29.454
<v Marshall, Jake>you know,
accomplish their goals and and arguably,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/70-4
00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:32.633
<v Marshall, Jake>you know,
more comprehensive ways in terms of the</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/70-5
00:13:32.633 --> 00:13:33.778
<v Marshall, Jake>scope of our data.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/72-0
00:13:33.858 --> 00:13:38.538
<v Marshall, Jake>And and you know a lot of times that is
you know completely disconnected from</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/72-1
00:13:38.538 --> 00:13:42.018
<v Marshall, Jake>from performance.
It's just that you know you've got this</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/71-0
00:13:39.578 --> 00:13:41.058
<v Miller, Jeremy>Sure, sure.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/72-2
00:13:42.018 --> 00:13:46.938
<v Marshall, Jake>group let us source other relevant HC PS
based on all you know what we do have at</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/72-3
00:13:46.938 --> 00:13:49.578
<v Marshall, Jake>scale which is their real world
behaviours.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/72-4
00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:53.778
<v Marshall, Jake>So again just just food for thought in
terms of how how some of that.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/73-0
00:13:54.058 --> 00:13:56.922
<v Marshall, Jake>So filing may have to go,
although ideally, right,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/73-1
00:13:56.922 --> 00:14:01.192
<v Marshall, Jake>we we we could have some cases where
we're doing it based off of, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/73-2
00:14:01.192 --> 00:14:04.674
<v Marshall, Jake>performance, you know,
campaign performance versus, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/73-3
00:14:04.674 --> 00:14:06.978
<v Marshall, Jake>their behaviors in the wild, so to speak.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/74-0
00:14:07.058 --> 00:14:11.171
<v Miller, Jeremy>Right. Yeah. And we can take, you know,
assuming this, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/74-1
00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:16.361
<v Miller, Jeremy>we go down this road, broadly speaking,
we can certainly do that at the start and</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/74-2
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:20.855
<v Miller, Jeremy>we can certainly then, you know,
find missed folks and and then we can</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/74-3
00:14:20.855 --> 00:14:22.058
<v Miller, Jeremy>look at engagement.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/78-0
00:14:22.418 --> 00:14:28.106
<v Miller, Jeremy>And and you know just share and share you
know analysis initially to help you know</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/78-1
00:14:28.106 --> 00:14:33.383
<v Miller, Jeremy>socialize that idea and build trust and
say you know things like look we you</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/76-0
00:14:28.738 --> 00:14:28.858
<v Popp, Andrew>OK.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/78-2
00:14:33.383 --> 00:14:38.111
<v Miller, Jeremy>asked for 1000, we gave you another 500,
you know these 200 engaged,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/78-3
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:42.018
<v Miller, Jeremy>we've got 500 more that look like those
but that aren't.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/79-0
00:14:42.098 --> 00:14:46.312
<v Miller, Jeremy>Part of your campaign or something.
So I I I understand that that there's a</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/77-0
00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:42.818
<v Popp, Andrew>OK.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/79-1
00:14:46.312 --> 00:14:50.747
<v Miller, Jeremy>there's a way that this work is done.
There's a culture around how this work is</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/79-2
00:14:50.747 --> 00:14:54.851
<v Miller, Jeremy>done and you know over time we can you
know try to help people as much as</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/79-3
00:14:54.851 --> 00:14:58.178
<v Miller, Jeremy>possible and and find those opportunities
for optimization.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/81-0
00:14:58.658 --> 00:15:01.902
<v Marshall, Jake>Cool. Jerry, Maggie,
it's just a practical question too.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/81-1
00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:06.399
<v Marshall, Jake>Like how does this work in terms of the
investment and and how the dollars are</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/80-0
00:15:02.138 --> 00:15:02.378
<v Miller, Jeremy>Yep.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/81-2
00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:09.018
<v Marshall, Jake>allotted to fund a massive project like
this?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/82-0
00:15:10.258 --> 00:15:14.338
<v Miller, Jeremy>I'm gonna BLOB that over to Hassan.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/83-0
00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:15.178
<v Malik, Hassan>So.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/84-0
00:15:14.738 --> 00:15:18.390
<v Marshall, Jake>There's an I I S because you know we have,
we have CapEx,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/84-1
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:23.427
<v Marshall, Jake>right and and part of that CapEx budget
is for report automation and we've been</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/84-2
00:15:23.427 --> 00:15:27.394
<v Marshall, Jake>kind of slugging, you know,
slogging away at all the different</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/84-3
00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:32.494
<v Marshall, Jake>technical work that we need to do to get
our data in a place to provide for that</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/84-4
00:15:32.494 --> 00:15:34.258
<v Marshall, Jake>automation, but right there.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/85-0
00:15:34.578 --> 00:15:38.367
<v Marshall, Jake>There is a limited CapEx budget.
So I just wondered like how much do we</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/85-1
00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:42.366
<v Marshall, Jake>need to think about next year's budget
and provide for something like this?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/85-2
00:15:42.366 --> 00:15:46.629
<v Marshall, Jake>It certainly seems like this won't be
cheap. And then you know, is it, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/85-3
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:49.050
<v Marshall, Jake>who's,
who's it ultimately on to make some of</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/85-4
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.207
<v Marshall, Jake>the decisions about where that money gets
allocated across across this and and</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/85-5
00:15:53.207 --> 00:15:54.418
<v Marshall, Jake>other similar projects?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/86-0
00:15:55.818 --> 00:16:02.798
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah. So I was going to bring it up.
So it's good that you guys already did.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/86-1
00:16:02.798 --> 00:16:10.231
<v Malik, Hassan>So I think we should figure out all teams
like that needs to participate here and</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/86-2
00:16:10.231 --> 00:16:12.498
<v Malik, Hassan>ensure that you know the.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/88-0
00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:16.563
<v Malik, Hassan>Estimates from all teams are collected,
including your own team, right?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/88-1
00:16:16.563 --> 00:16:20.122
<v Malik, Hassan>Because you will be, you know,
so if even if other teams are doing</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/88-2
00:16:20.122 --> 00:16:22.991
<v Malik, Hassan>technical work,
you'll be heavily involved in design,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/88-3
00:16:22.991 --> 00:16:25.381
<v Malik, Hassan>validation, testing, etcetera,
and you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/88-4
00:16:25.381 --> 00:16:29.738
<v Malik, Hassan>advising on data and so on and so forth.
So we put it together and maybe take it.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/89-0
00:16:30.058 --> 00:16:35.942
<v Malik, Hassan>You know as a business case and that
business case will need to be approved</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/89-1
00:16:35.942 --> 00:16:41.284
<v Malik, Hassan>like for the initiative to launch.
So I was asked to provide overall</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/89-2
00:16:41.284 --> 00:16:46.859
<v Malik, Hassan>estimates for my entire department.
You know for 2026 I we did put some</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/89-3
00:16:46.859 --> 00:16:48.098
<v Malik, Hassan>resources there.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/90-0
00:16:49.538 --> 00:16:52.621
<v Malik, Hassan>But that's only the data science
resources.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/90-1
00:16:52.621 --> 00:16:58.157
<v Malik, Hassan>So I know Imran have done the same thing.
Imran, you know, attended, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/90-2
00:16:58.157 --> 00:17:03.342
<v Malik, Hassan>the New York meeting with all of us and I
think his team is will be doing</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/90-3
00:17:03.342 --> 00:17:08.178
<v Malik, Hassan>engineering work, et cetera.
But I think we need a meeting with all.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/91-0
00:17:08.258 --> 00:17:11.754
<v Malik, Hassan>Involved team.
So let's make sure we put together all</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/91-1
00:17:11.754 --> 00:17:17.064
<v Malik, Hassan>the estimates together and then I think
one of you will need to or or or maybe we</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/91-2
00:17:17.064 --> 00:17:22.180
<v Malik, Hassan>can just have a joint meeting with Chris
Caneta and you know Diane or you know</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/91-3
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:22.698
<v Malik, Hassan>whoever.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/92-0
00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:30.458
<v Malik, Hassan>Is the ELT member that will need to get
need to seek approval from ELT?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/93-0
00:17:30.418 --> 00:17:33.366
<v Marshall, Jake>That's right.
Because there there's certainly a world</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/93-1
00:17:33.366 --> 00:17:37.353
<v Marshall, Jake>where we would have to, you know,
chunk us out and prioritize it, right.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/93-2
00:17:37.353 --> 00:17:41.558
<v Marshall, Jake>And and certainly some of these are
forward-thinking enough that there isn't</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/93-3
00:17:41.558 --> 00:17:45.818
<v Marshall, Jake>going to be an immediate, you know,
financial upside for us in business case.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/94-0
00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:49.958
<v Marshall, Jake>It it's it's you know so I I so thank you
for answering that.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/94-1
00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:55.298
<v Marshall, Jake>I feel like you know we will have to have
those conversations to your point and and</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/94-2
00:17:55.298 --> 00:18:00.065
<v Marshall, Jake>you know again there's there's not I
don't think there's direct commercial</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/94-3
00:18:00.065 --> 00:18:04.578
<v Marshall, Jake>opportunity in the way that that you all
are envisioning just because.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/96-0
00:18:04.578 --> 00:18:08.684
<v Marshall, Jake>You know, our clients, you know, 9.
5 times out of 10 are like, hey,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/96-1
00:18:08.684 --> 00:18:13.325
<v Marshall, Jake>here is my list, deliver against my list.
Do not do anything else. If you do,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/96-2
00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:18.265
<v Marshall, Jake>you're out of compliance and you're fired.
So you know this idea that there's this</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/96-3
00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:21.657
<v Marshall, Jake>massive amount of upside by sourcing
other HC PS. Again,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/96-4
00:18:21.657 --> 00:18:23.978
<v Marshall, Jake>I don't want to throw cold water on it.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/97-0
00:18:24.578 --> 00:18:29.091
<v Marshall, Jake>But I do think it may be more limited
than you're envisioning now given who our</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/95-0
00:18:25.658 --> 00:18:25.738
<v Malik, Hassan>It.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/97-1
00:18:29.091 --> 00:18:33.098
<v Marshall, Jake>buyers are and how and how we have to
execute on on their media plans.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/99-0
00:18:33.898 --> 00:18:36.949
<v Malik, Hassan>Got it.
So actually there are two different value</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/99-1
00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.633
<v Malik, Hassan>propositions here, right?
Not not just one.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/99-2
00:18:39.633 --> 00:18:43.966
<v Malik, Hassan>So and and the business value is
absolutely up to you guys, right. So,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/99-3
00:18:43.966 --> 00:18:46.895
<v Malik, Hassan>so we can we get, we are,
we are technologists,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/98-0
00:18:45.898 --> 00:18:49.058
<v Marshall, Jake>For sure. Yeah, no, we love it.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/99-4
00:18:46.895 --> 00:18:49.458
<v Malik, Hassan>we get excited about you know the yeah so.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/101-0
00:18:49.778 --> 00:18:54.561
<v Malik, Hassan>So, so the other opportunity is, you know,
making it more sticky,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/101-1
00:18:54.561 --> 00:18:59.851
<v Malik, Hassan>making it more valuable, right.
And even so even if the HCP list doesn't</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/100-0
00:18:55.658 --> 00:18:56.138
<v Marshall, Jake>Mhm.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/101-2
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:04.852
<v Malik, Hassan>change, let's say, right,
there is still an opportunity to buy more.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/101-3
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:09.418
<v Malik, Hassan>So, so one, you know,
justify or or make a much stronger case.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/102-0
00:19:09.618 --> 00:19:12.892
<v Malik, Hassan>You know,
by combining with RWD and producing all</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/102-1
00:19:12.892 --> 00:19:16.756
<v Malik, Hassan>kind of, you know,
um analytics to use us right instead of</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/102-2
00:19:16.756 --> 00:19:20.620
<v Malik, Hassan>someone who doesn't have RWD.
So that's one aspect, right?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/104-0
00:19:19.578 --> 00:19:22.143
<v Marshall, Jake>Right. But Hassan,
just just the level set,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/102-3
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.258
<v Malik, Hassan>And then that can simply.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/104-1
00:19:22.143 --> 00:19:25.815
<v Marshall, Jake>we are doing that now.
We're just not doing it in an automated</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/104-2
00:19:25.815 --> 00:19:29.546
<v Marshall, Jake>platform, but like Spiro, our team,
we're doing that every day.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/103-0
00:19:27.018 --> 00:19:27.658
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/104-3
00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:30.538
<v Marshall, Jake>But but go ahead.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/105-0
00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:33.573
<v Malik, Hassan>Yeah, understood. So, so,
so we automate that,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/105-1
00:19:33.573 --> 00:19:38.224
<v Malik, Hassan>but the but the more revenue can
potentially come with building some of</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/105-2
00:19:38.224 --> 00:19:43.262
<v Malik, Hassan>these capabilities that can now go ahead
and target the same let's say SA PS,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/105-3
00:19:43.262 --> 00:19:47.138
<v Malik, Hassan>but using not not just relying on our
third party partners.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/106-0
00:19:47.538 --> 00:19:52.447
<v Malik, Hassan>So we can, you know, automatically.
So we discuss this idea of building,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/106-1
00:19:52.447 --> 00:19:55.473
<v Malik, Hassan>you know,
that audience directly for a given</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/106-2
00:19:55.473 --> 00:20:00.987
<v Malik, Hassan>campaign and then going and targeting,
you know, ourselves for example, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/106-3
00:20:00.987 --> 00:20:02.938
<v Malik, Hassan>on Google and you know other.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/107-0
00:20:03.338 --> 00:20:08.091
<v Malik, Hassan>Exchanges and that can reduce the cost
but also increase the scale, right.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/107-1
00:20:08.091 --> 00:20:13.034
<v Malik, Hassan>So it is again the business value is
something that you guys can define right</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/107-2
00:20:13.034 --> 00:20:17.978
<v Malik, Hassan>and and and help understand how big that
opportunity would be. I do not know.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/108-0
00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:20.618
<v Marshall, Jake>Yeah, no, that's that's helpful.
Thank you.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/109-0
00:20:23.378 --> 00:20:26.229
<v Malik, Hassan>And we can take a slow approach as well,
right?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/109-1
00:20:26.229 --> 00:20:30.626
<v Malik, Hassan>So let so it it's not all or nothing.
Maybe you know can provide bunch of</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/112-0
00:20:30.058 --> 00:20:32.621
<v Marshall, Jake>Yeah, no, yeah.
And I know part of this is just big ideas</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/109-2
00:20:30.626 --> 00:20:31.458
<v Malik, Hassan>options, yeah.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/112-1
00:20:32.621 --> 00:20:36.112
<v Marshall, Jake>and how do how do we really move this
thing along and get greater integration.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/110-0
00:20:33.538 --> 00:20:34.138
<v Malik, Hassan>Yep.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/112-2
00:20:36.112 --> 00:20:39.692
<v Marshall, Jake>So I'm I'm spiro and I are all for it.
You know we just want to you know balance</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/111-0
00:20:37.698 --> 00:20:38.058
Yeah.

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/112-3
00:20:39.692 --> 00:20:43.184
<v Marshall, Jake>it out with with the practical and the
business case but but we appreciate the</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/112-4
00:20:43.184 --> 00:20:43.538
<v Marshall, Jake>support.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/113-0
00:20:43.658 --> 00:20:47.247
<v Skokos, Spiro>And Jake,
remember we had discussed that minimum,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/113-1
00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:52.775
<v Skokos, Spiro>possibly an outfacing portal to our
customers where they could just grab our</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/113-2
00:20:52.775 --> 00:20:57.658
<v Skokos, Spiro>published reports in addition to getting
them from the sales folks.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/115-0
00:20:58.578 --> 00:21:02.278
<v Marshall, Jake>Yeah, no,
I I do think there's there's definitely a</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/115-1
00:21:02.278 --> 00:21:07.473
<v Marshall, Jake>a path of lesser resistance there that
that we could ultimately opt for,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/115-2
00:21:07.473 --> 00:21:12.810
<v Marshall, Jake>you know and and potentially you know as
a precursor to you know a full on</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/114-0
00:21:08.458 --> 00:21:08.738
<v Skokos, Spiro>Yeah.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/115-3
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.938
<v Marshall, Jake>reporting dashboard like we're thinking
in you know Q3Q4.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/116-0
00:21:21.618 --> 00:21:24.058
<v Marshall, Jake>Cool. Jeremy, please continue.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/117-0
00:21:22.978 --> 00:21:27.014
<v Miller, Jeremy>All right. Yeah. OK.
So that's the high level. Again, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/117-1
00:21:27.014 --> 00:21:31.366
<v Miller, Jeremy>the the, the point here is like you said,
Jake, throw out big ideas,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/117-2
00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:35.087
<v Miller, Jeremy>get something written down,
have it as a a starting point,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/117-3
00:21:35.087 --> 00:21:36.538
<v Miller, Jeremy>a basis for discussion.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/119-0
00:21:37.778 --> 00:21:41.370
<v Miller, Jeremy>So a lot of the rest of,
I'm going to share this deck with you.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/119-1
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:45.918
<v Miller, Jeremy>A lot of the rest of this deck is really
sort of detailed views of what that may</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/119-2
00:21:45.918 --> 00:21:50.016
<v Miller, Jeremy>look like on a quarter by quarter basis.
There's a lot of words in here.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/119-3
00:21:50.016 --> 00:21:53.272
<v Miller, Jeremy>I'm not going to read them to you,
but this is, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/119-4
00:21:53.272 --> 00:21:57.258
<v Miller, Jeremy>a sketch of what that might look like in
terms of deliverables across.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/120-0
00:21:57.418 --> 00:22:02.591
<v Miller, Jeremy>Orders for each of the three work streams.
So I won't scroll through all of that.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/120-1
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:05.936
<v Miller, Jeremy>It's there in the deck and I'll share
this with you.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/120-2
00:22:05.936 --> 00:22:10.920
<v Miller, Jeremy>But I think one thing that I do want to
go to is that second value proposition</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/120-3
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.211
<v Miller, Jeremy>that Hassan talked about,
which I'm calling the integrated platform</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/120-4
00:22:15.211 --> 00:22:16.978
<v Miller, Jeremy>or the platform work stream.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/121-0
00:22:17.178 --> 00:22:20.047
<v Miller, Jeremy>You know,
I I tried to lay out how I thought this</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/121-1
00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:24.294
<v Miller, Jeremy>would look if we if we, you know,
sort of went all in and what this looks</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/121-2
00:22:24.294 --> 00:22:29.058
<v Miller, Jeremy>like and obviously this could be done at
at different levels of scale or different</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/121-3
00:22:29.058 --> 00:22:33.018
<v Miller, Jeremy>components or different levels of effort
and so forth, but you know.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/122-0
00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:37.960
<v Miller, Jeremy>My ask here is kind of take a look at my
thinking here and and sort of validate it,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/122-1
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.534
<v Miller, Jeremy>hear your thoughts, hear your questions.
But it seems like the real opportunity,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/122-2
00:22:42.534 --> 00:22:46.430
<v Miller, Jeremy>as Hassan mentioned to me,
if we're going to go down this path is as</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/122-3
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.818
<v Miller, Jeremy>much as possible cutting out some of
those middle surfaces.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/123-0
00:22:50.018 --> 00:22:53.429
<v Miller, Jeremy>To have it the integrated platform where
people can, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/123-1
00:22:53.429 --> 00:22:57.544
<v Miller, Jeremy>buy space on skip to buy space through
demand side platforms all in one go,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/123-2
00:22:57.544 --> 00:23:00.576
<v Miller, Jeremy>get the reporting and analytics back in
the same place.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/123-3
00:23:00.576 --> 00:23:04.041
<v Miller, Jeremy>And then that is what allows for when
clients are ready for it,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/123-4
00:23:04.041 --> 00:23:08.156
<v Miller, Jeremy>a really high level of optimization
because all that data sits in one place</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/123-5
00:23:08.156 --> 00:23:09.618
<v Miller, Jeremy>and it's really easy to do.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/124-0
00:23:09.778 --> 00:23:12.658
<v Miller, Jeremy>that kind of analytics and optimization
quickly.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/125-0
00:23:15.618 --> 00:23:18.458
<v Miller, Jeremy>So I'll pause here again for thoughts and
questions.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/126-0
00:23:21.378 --> 00:23:29.675
<v Marshall, Jake>I mean, I I get what you're saying.
There's going to be cases where you know</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/126-1
00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:37.218
<v Marshall, Jake>that after example will work.
Most of the time it won't just because.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/128-0
00:23:37.218 --> 00:23:42.392
<v Marshall, Jake>Clients have master service agreements
with agencies and they have to run this</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/128-1
00:23:42.392 --> 00:23:45.274
<v Marshall, Jake>media through them with their
partnerships.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/128-2
00:23:45.274 --> 00:23:48.288
<v Marshall, Jake>So just not all of them but but most of
them.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/128-3
00:23:48.288 --> 00:23:53.200
<v Marshall, Jake>So you know we're and and nor do we
probably want to be in the business of</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/128-4
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.738
<v Marshall, Jake>undercutting our our core client which is
the agency.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/129-0
00:23:57.098 --> 00:24:01.630
<v Marshall, Jake>But you know,
this is something we could socialize with</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/129-1
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:08.186
<v Marshall, Jake>with other leadership team members and
get their thoughts as well. But you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/129-2
00:24:08.186 --> 00:24:14.013
<v Marshall, Jake>you know the idea of, you know,
60% of our businesses is CMI if if they</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/129-3
00:24:14.013 --> 00:24:14.418
<v Marshall, Jake>were.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/130-0
00:24:14.658 --> 00:24:17.616
<v Marshall, Jake>You know,
if they understood that we were going to</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/130-1
00:24:17.616 --> 00:24:22.025
<v Marshall, Jake>brands directly and intentionally kind of
cutting them out of this piece of</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/130-2
00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:26.317
<v Marshall, Jake>business that could potentially tank all
of Skipta. But again, in theory,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/130-3
00:24:26.317 --> 00:24:28.058
<v Marshall, Jake>I get what you're saying here.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/132-0
00:24:28.098 --> 00:24:31.601
<v Malik, Hassan>So, so, so actually I'm not sure if we're,
you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/132-1
00:24:31.601 --> 00:24:34.773
<v Malik, Hassan>talking about cutting down the agencies,
right.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/132-2
00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:39.466
<v Malik, Hassan>We are talking about cutting down or not
even maybe cutting them down.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/132-3
00:24:39.466 --> 00:24:44.621
<v Malik, Hassan>So the the third party providers that we
use to run programmatic campaigns at</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/132-4
00:24:44.621 --> 00:24:45.018
<v Malik, Hassan>scale.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/133-0
00:24:45.218 --> 00:24:48.015
<v Malik, Hassan>So we're talking about them, right.
So the so,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/133-1
00:24:48.015 --> 00:24:52.658
<v Malik, Hassan>so essentially we did do X amount of
business with them right now which costs</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/133-2
00:24:52.658 --> 00:24:57.242
<v Malik, Hassan>us certain amount of money we can and we
were looking at something like $14.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/133-3
00:24:57.242 --> 00:25:00.338
<v Malik, Hassan>15 dollars CPM there,
correct from what I remember.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/134-0
00:25:02.498 --> 00:25:05.520
<v Malik, Hassan>So the average CPM S on,
let's say Google Edex,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/134-1
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.243
<v Malik, Hassan>which is the largest exchange, you know,
tend to be like 2 bucks, 3 bucks.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/134-2
00:25:10.243 --> 00:25:14.904
<v Malik, Hassan>So there's a very substantial margin
involved there that from these third</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/134-3
00:25:14.904 --> 00:25:17.738
<v Malik, Hassan>party, you know,
partners that we are using.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/135-0
00:25:18.178 --> 00:25:23.246
<v Malik, Hassan>So what so so so we can be but but they
are providing this very substantial value</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/135-1
00:25:23.246 --> 00:25:28.437
<v Malik, Hassan>we should acknowledge that of mapping you
know tracking down all these HCPS and and</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/135-2
00:25:28.437 --> 00:25:31.157
<v Malik, Hassan>and you know mapping their devices to
them.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/135-3
00:25:31.157 --> 00:25:34.062
<v Malik, Hassan>So they're essentially building this
audience.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/135-4
00:25:34.062 --> 00:25:38.018
<v Malik, Hassan>So so that part is non trivial frankly
and unless we can build.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/136-0
00:25:38.098 --> 00:25:42.878
<v Malik, Hassan>Build a very substantial presence on a
very large number of sites with all kind</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/136-1
00:25:42.878 --> 00:25:47.719
<v Malik, Hassan>of things. We can't build that at our own.
So the idea there was that everything</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/136-2
00:25:47.719 --> 00:25:51.723
<v Malik, Hassan>that is today remains in place,
including the agency relationship,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/136-3
00:25:51.723 --> 00:25:54.830
<v Malik, Hassan>including this third party relationship
by the way.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/136-4
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.938
<v Malik, Hassan>But then when we use things like
impression pixels.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/138-0
00:25:58.018 --> 00:26:03.913
<v Malik, Hassan>And click pixels to essentially start
building those audiences ourselves, right,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/138-1
00:26:03.913 --> 00:26:08.279
<v Malik, Hassan>with Google, etc.
And then we can simply sell more media so</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/137-0
00:26:04.378 --> 00:26:04.858
<v Marshall, Jake>Mhm.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/138-2
00:26:08.279 --> 00:26:13.738
<v Malik, Hassan>we can keep the current budgets with
these third party providers constant.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/139-0
00:26:14.018 --> 00:26:18.915
<v Malik, Hassan>But instead of growing with them,
we grow ourselves and that would cost us</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/139-1
00:26:18.915 --> 00:26:22.767
<v Malik, Hassan>substantially less.
And we can actually increase the scale</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/139-2
00:26:22.767 --> 00:26:26.162
<v Malik, Hassan>because then we can pay the exchange
directly more,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/139-3
00:26:26.162 --> 00:26:30.863
<v Malik, Hassan>substantially more than average,
which can give us a lot more scale for</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/139-4
00:26:30.863 --> 00:26:31.778
<v Malik, Hassan>the same SEPs.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/141-0
00:26:33.138 --> 00:26:37.727
<v Malik, Hassan>And there could be places outside of what
they're able to target these third party,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/141-1
00:26:37.727 --> 00:26:40.404
<v Malik, Hassan>you know,
providers they're able to target right</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/141-2
00:26:40.404 --> 00:26:43.355
<v Malik, Hassan>now, maybe opportunities there.
So that was the idea.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/141-3
00:26:43.355 --> 00:26:45.759
<v Malik, Hassan>So the business relationship remain
intact,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/141-4
00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:48.218
<v Malik, Hassan>it's just incremental revenue
opportunately.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/140-0
00:26:46.978 --> 00:26:47.098
<v Marshall, Jake>OK.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/142-0
00:26:48.578 --> 00:26:48.698
<v Malik, Hassan>Hey.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/143-0
00:26:51.618 --> 00:26:54.662
<v Marshall, Jake>Yeah, understood.
This is this is more Frank's domain,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/143-1
00:26:54.662 --> 00:26:57.098
<v Marshall, Jake>but we'll we'll loop him into this as
well.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/144-0
00:26:56.418 --> 00:27:01.318
<v Malik, Hassan>Cool. Yeah. And I've worked in that,
you know, world for a long time,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/144-1
00:27:01.318 --> 00:27:05.238
<v Malik, Hassan>including my own startup.
And after that and at Amazon,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/144-2
00:27:05.238 --> 00:27:09.158
<v Malik, Hassan>I know how sensitive agency relationships
are. So yeah,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/144-3
00:27:09.158 --> 00:27:11.538
<v Malik, Hassan>I wouldn't want to mess with that.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/146-0
00:27:17.738 --> 00:27:19.058
<v Miller, Jeremy>Anything else here?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/147-0
00:27:21.458 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Marshall, Jake>Sorry,
I've got a screaming child in the</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/148-0
00:27:23.418 --> 00:27:25.658
<v Miller, Jeremy>Oh, no worries.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/147-1
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.778
<v Marshall, Jake>background. Please continue.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/149-0
00:27:27.138 --> 00:27:30.013
<v Miller, Jeremy>All right.
And then I've laid out just some again</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/149-1
00:27:30.013 --> 00:27:34.097
<v Miller, Jeremy>preliminary thoughts about what
dependencies and risk looks like would</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/149-2
00:27:34.097 --> 00:27:38.238
<v Miller, Jeremy>look like for a plan like this.
You know what we would need you know to</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/149-3
00:27:38.238 --> 00:27:42.954
<v Miller, Jeremy>get have get done each quarter to kind of
go along this plan obviously subject to</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/149-4
00:27:42.954 --> 00:27:46.002
<v Miller, Jeremy>adjustment,
but just saying you know if we went down</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/149-5
00:27:46.002 --> 00:27:46.578
<v Miller, Jeremy>this road.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/151-0
00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:50.389
<v Miller, Jeremy>Kind of what would this look like in
terms of those things?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/151-1
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:54.987
<v Miller, Jeremy>What would be the kind of main risks that
would come across technical business</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/151-2
00:27:54.987 --> 00:27:58.478
<v Miller, Jeremy>resource domains?
And I'll I'll leave this with you for for</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/151-3
00:27:58.478 --> 00:28:03.017
<v Miller, Jeremy>processing and adding and go ahead and
edit this document directly or take it</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/151-4
00:28:03.017 --> 00:28:04.298
<v Miller, Jeremy>however we want to do.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/152-0
00:28:04.978 --> 00:28:09.975
<v Miller, Jeremy>And then what would success metrics and
APIs look like again for this broad,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/152-1
00:28:09.975 --> 00:28:15.037
<v Miller, Jeremy>ambitious plan where we kind of engage in
all three of these work streams and</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/152-2
00:28:15.037 --> 00:28:18.218
<v Miller, Jeremy>allocate a bunch of people to it and go
forward?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/153-0
00:28:19.578 --> 00:28:19.658
<v Miller, Jeremy>Um.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/154-0
00:28:21.778 --> 00:28:26.339
<v Miller, Jeremy>So that's the presentation.
I think it's the input that I've gotten</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/154-1
00:28:26.339 --> 00:28:30.162
<v Miller, Jeremy>from that we've gotten from you guys so
far is is great.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/154-2
00:28:30.162 --> 00:28:35.595
<v Miller, Jeremy>Obviously important that we're completely
on the same page about what's going to</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/154-3
00:28:35.595 --> 00:28:37.138
<v Miller, Jeremy>provide the most value.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/155-0
00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:42.042
<v Miller, Jeremy>As far as next steps, you know,
if there's anything else you want to</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/155-1
00:28:42.042 --> 00:28:45.658
<v Miller, Jeremy>discuss today, let's do it. Otherwise,
I would say, you know,</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/155-2
00:28:45.658 --> 00:28:49.391
<v Miller, Jeremy>let's take this away.
Let's have get a little feedback from you</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/155-3
00:28:49.391 --> 00:28:54.173
<v Miller, Jeremy>after you've maybe had a little time to
digest some of the details and then start</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/155-4
00:28:54.173 --> 00:28:57.498
<v Miller, Jeremy>to plan that session that Hassan talked
about, which is.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/156-0
00:28:57.698 --> 00:29:00.135
<v Miller, Jeremy>You know,
what would it look like across a couple</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/156-1
00:29:00.135 --> 00:29:02.524
<v Miller, Jeremy>of different teams?
What would the size be like?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/156-2
00:29:02.524 --> 00:29:06.035
<v Miller, Jeremy>What would the effort be like?
And then do and then going down the road</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/156-3
00:29:06.035 --> 00:29:07.498
<v Miller, Jeremy>of building the business case?</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/157-0
00:29:09.498 --> 00:29:10.978
<v Marshall, Jake>OK, excellent. Um.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/158-0
00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:17.125
<v Marshall, Jake>We can,
we can certainly you know aim to you know</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/158-1
00:29:17.125 --> 00:29:22.736
<v Marshall, Jake>get back to you in a week or so just in
terms of just really going through this</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/158-2
00:29:22.736 --> 00:29:26.243
<v Marshall, Jake>and and hopefully sharing it across some
more Lt.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/158-3
00:29:26.243 --> 00:29:31.784
<v Marshall, Jake>members to and and Frank and Peter as
well in particular and then you know you</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/158-4
00:29:31.784 --> 00:29:33.538
<v Marshall, Jake>guys let us know kind of.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/159-0
00:29:33.618 --> 00:29:39.295
<v Marshall, Jake>Next steps on you know chatting about you
know our our time investment and how that</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/159-1
00:29:39.295 --> 00:29:43.418
<v Marshall, Jake>should come together.
You know we can kind of go from there.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/160-0
00:29:47.058 --> 00:29:49.018
<v Miller, Jeremy>OK. That sounds like a good plan to me.</v>

f23f0711-a20c-4b88-a944-c6d9b0291b00/161-0
00:29:52.258 --> 00:29:54.691
